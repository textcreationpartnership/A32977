         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <p>COnſidering how neceſſary it is that the Word of God, which is the only food of the Soul, and that moſt excellent Light that we muſt walk by, in this our moſt dangerous Pilgri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage, ſhould at all convenient times be Preached unto the People, that thereby they may both learn their Duty towards God, their Prince,
<pb facs="tcp:54673:3"/> and their Neighbours, according to the Mind of the Holy Ghoſt, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed in the Scriptures: And al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo to avoid the manifold Enormi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties which heretofore by falſe Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine have crept into the Church of God: And how that all they which are appointed Miniſters, have not the Gift of Preaching ſufficiently to inſtruct the People, which is committed unto them, whereof great inconveniences might riſe, and ignorance ſtill be main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained, if ſome honeſt Remedy be not ſpeedily found, and provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded.

Furthermore, Her Highneſs Commandeth, that notwithſtanding this Order, the ſaid Eccleſiaſtical Perſons ſhall read Her Majeſties Injunctions at ſuch times, and in ſuch or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, as in the Book thereof ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed.

                  <div n="1" type="part">
                     <p>UNto a Chriſtian Man there can be nothing either more neceſſary or profitable,<note place="margin">The praiſe of Holy Scripture.</note> than the Knowledge of Holy Scripture, foraſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much as in it is contained God's true Word, ſetting forth his Glory, and alſo Man's Duty.<note place="margin">The perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of Holy Scripture. The know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of Holy Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture is neceſſary. To whom the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of Holy Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is ſweet and pleaſant. Who be enemies to Holy Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture.</note> And there is no Truth nor Doctrine neceſſary for our Juſtification and everlaſting Salvation, but that is (or may be,) drawn out of that Fountain and Well of Truth. Therefore as many as be deſirous to enter into the Right and Perfect way unto God, muſt apply their Minds to know Holy Scripture, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the which, they can neither ſufficiently know God, and his Will, neither their Office and Duty. And as Drink is pleaſant to them that be Drie, and Meat to them that be Hungry; So is the Reading, Hearing, Searching, and Studying of Holy Scripture, to them that be deſirous to know God or them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and to do his Will. And their Stomachs on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly do loath and abhor the Heavenly Knowledge and Food of God's Word, that be ſo drowned in world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Vanities, that they neither favour God, nor any Godlineſs: For that is the cauſe, why they deſire ſuch Vanities, rather than the time knowledge of God.
<pb facs="tcp:54673:8"/> As they that are ſick of an Ague,<note place="margin">An apt Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>militude, declaring of whom the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture is abhorred.

Matth. 4. The Holy Scripture is a ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine for our Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation. What things we may learn in the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture.</note> whatſoever they eat and drink, (though it be never ſo pleaſant,) yet it is as bitter to them as Wormwood, not for the bitterneſs of the Meat, but for the corrupt and bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter humor that is in their own Tongue and Mouth: Even ſo is the ſweetneſs of God's Word bitter, not of itſelf, but only unto them that have their Minds corrupted with long cuſtom of Sin, and love of this World. Therefore forſaking the corrupt judgment of fleſhly Men, which care not but for their Carkaſs: Let us reverently hear and read Holy Scripture, which is the Food of the Soul: Let us diligently ſearch for the Well of Life, in the Books of the New and Old Teſtament, and not run to the ſtinking Puddles of Mens Traditions (deviſed by Mens Imagination,) for our Juſtification and Salvation. For in Holy Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture is fully contained what we ought to do, and what to eſchew; what to believe, what to love, and what to look for at God's hands at length. In theſe Books we ſhall find the Father from whom, the Son by whom, and the Holy Ghoſt in whom, all Things have their Being, and Keeping up; And theſe Three Perſons to be but One God, and One Subſtance. In theſe Books we may learn to know ourſelves, how Vile and Miſerable we be, and alſo to know God, how Good He is of Himſelf, and how He maketh us and all Creatures partakers of His Goodneſs. We may learn alſo in theſe Books to know God's Will and Pleaſure, as much as (for this preſent time,) is convenient for us to know. And (as the great Clerk and godly Preacher St. <hi>John Chryſoſtom</hi> ſaith,) whatſoever is required to the Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of Man is fully contained in the Scripture of God. He that is Ignorant, may there learn, and have Knowledge. He that is Hard-hearted, and an obſtinate Sinner, ſhall there find Everlaſting Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments (prepared of God's Juſtice,) to make him afraid, and to mollifie or ſoften him. He that is oppreſſed with Miſery in this World, ſhall there find Relief in the promiſes of Everlaſting Life, to
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:54673:8"/> his great Conſolation and Comfort. He that is wound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the Devil unto death, ſhall find there Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cine whereby he may be reſtored again unto Health; If it ſhall require to teach any Truth, or reprove any falſe Doctrine, to rebuke any Vice, to commend any Virtue, to give good Counſel, to Comfort or Exhort, or to do any other thing requiſite for our Salvation; All thoſe things (ſaith <hi>St. Chryſoſtome,</hi>) we may learn plentifully of the Scripture. There is (ſaith <hi>Fulgentius,</hi>) abundantly enough,<note place="margin">Holy Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtreth ſufficient Doctrine for all De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees and Ages. Matth. 4. Luke 3. John 17. Pſal. 19. What commodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and Profits, the knowledge of Holy Scripture bringeth.</note> both for Men to eat, and Children to ſuck. There is, whatſoever is meet for all Ages, and for all Degrees and ſorts of Men. Theſe Books therefore ought to be much in our Hands, in our Eyes, in our Ears, in our Mouths, but moſt of all in our Hearts. For the Scripture of God is the Heavenly Meat of our Souls, the Hearing and Keeping of it maketh us Bleſſed, Sanctifieth us, and maketh us Holy; it turneth our Souls, it is a light Lanthorn to our Feet, it is a ſure, ſtedfaſt, and ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting inſtrument of Salvation, it giveth Wiſdom to the humble and lowly Hearts, it Comforteth, maketh Glad, Cheereth and Cheriſheth our Conſcience: It is a more excellent Jewel or Treaſure, than any Gold or precious Stone, it is more ſweet than Honey, or Honey-comb; it is called the beſt part, which <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi> did chooſe, for it hath in it everlaſting Comfort. The Words of Holy Scripture be called Words of Everlaſting Life: For they be God's Inſtruments or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained for the ſame purpoſe. They have power to turn through God's Promiſe, and they be effectual through God's aſſiſtence;<note place="margin">Luke 10. John 6.</note> and (being received in a faithful Heart,) they have ever an Heavenly ſpiritual working in them: They are lively, quick, and migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in Operation, and ſharper than any two-edged Sword, and enter through,<note place="margin">Heb. 4.</note> even to the dividing aſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of the Soul and the Spirit, of the Joints and the Marrow; Chriſt calleth him a Wiſe Builder,<note place="margin">Matth. 7.</note> that Buildeth upon his Word, upon his ſure and ſubſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial Foundation. By this Word of God, we ſhall be judged: For the Word that I ſpeak (ſaith Chriſt,<note place="margin">John. 12.</note>) is
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:54673:9"/> it, that ſhall judge in the laſt day. He that keepeth the Word of Chriſt, is promiſed the Love and Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of God,<note place="margin">John 14.</note> and that he ſhall be the Dwelling-place, or Temple of the Bleſſed Trinity. This Word, whoſoever is diligent to Read, and in his Heart to Print that he readeth, the great affection to the tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitory things of this World ſhall be miniſhed in him, and the great deſire of Heavenly things (that be therein promiſed of God,) ſhall increaſe in him. And there is nothing that ſo much ſtrengthneth our Faith and Truſt in God, that ſo much keepeth up Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency and Pureneſs of the Heart, and alſo of out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Godly Life and Converſation, as continual Reading, and recording of God's Word. For that thing, which (by continual uſe of Reading of Holy Scripture, and diligent ſearching of the ſame,) is deeply Printed and Graven in the Heart, at length turneth almoſt into Nature. And moreover, the Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect and Virtue of God's Word is, to illuminate the Ignorant, and to give more light unto them, that faithfully and diligently read it, to comfort their Hearts, and to encourage them to perform that, which of God is commanded.<note place="margin">1 Reg. 14. 2 Per. 20. 1 Cor. 15. 1 John 5.</note> It teacheth Patience in all Adverſity, in Proſperity Humbleneſs: What Honour is due unto GOD: What Mercy and Chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to our Neighbour. It giveth good Counſel in all doubtful things. It ſheweth of whom we ſhall look for Aid and help in all Perils, and that God is the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly giver of Victory, in all Battels and Temptations of our Enemies,<note place="margin">Who pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit moſt in reading Gods Word.</note> Bodily and Ghoſtly. And in read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of God's Word, he not always moſt profiteth that is moſt ready in turning of the Book, or in ſaying of it without the Book; but he that is moſt turned into it, that is moſt inſpired with the Holy Ghoſt, moſt in his Heart and Life altered and changed into that thing which he readeth: He that is daily leſs and leſs Proud, leſs Wrathful, leſs Covetous, and leſs deſirous of worldly and vain Pleaſures: He that daily (forſaking his old vicious Life,) increaſeth in Virtue more and more. And to be ſhort, there is
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:54673:9"/> nothing that more maintaineth Godlineſs of the Mind, and driveth away Ungodlineſs, than doth the conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nual Reading or Hearing of God's Word,<note place="margin">Eſa. 5.

And on the other ſide, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more darkeneth Chriſt, and the Glory of God, nor bringeth in more Blindneſs, and all kinds of Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, than doth the ignorance of God's Word.</p>

                     <head>The Second part of the Sermon of the Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of Holy Scripture.</head>
                     <p>IN the firſt part of this Sermon, which exhorteth to the Knowledge of Holy Scripture, was declared wherefore the knowledge of the ſame is neceſſary and profitable to all Men, and that by the true Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge and Underſtanding of Scripture, the moſt ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary points of our Duty towards God and our Neighbors are alſo known. Now as concerning the ſame Matter, you ſhall hear what followeth. If we profeſs Chriſt, Why be we not aſhamed to be igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant in his Doctrine? Seeing that every Man is aſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to be ignorant in that Learning which he profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth. That Man is aſhamed to be called a Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher, which readeth not the Books of Philoſophy, and to be called a Lawyer, an Aſtronomer,<note place="margin">God's Word ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>celleth all Sciences.</note> or Phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſian, that is ignorant in the Books of Law, Aſtro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomy, and Phyſick. How can any Man then ſay, that he profeſſeth Chriſt and his Religion, if he will not apply himſelf (as far forth as he can or may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniently,) to read and hear, and ſo to know the Books of Chriſt's Goſpel and Doctrine? Although other Sciences be good, and to be learned, yet no Man can deny, but this is the chief, and paſſeth all other incomparably. What excuſe ſhall we therefore make
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:54673:10"/> (at the laſt day before Chriſt) that delight to read or hear Mens Phantaſies and Inventions, more than his moſt Holy Goſpel? And will find no time to do that, which chiefly (above all things,) we ſhould do, and will rather read other things than that, for the which we ought rather to leave reading of all other things. Let us therefore apply ourſelves, as far forth as we can have time and leiſure,<note place="margin">Vain excu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes diſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding from the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of God's Word. The Firſt. The Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond. Matth. 22.</note> to know God's Word, by diligent hearing and reading thereof, as many as pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs God, and have Faith and Truſt in Him. But they that have no good affection to God's Word (to colour this their fault,) alledge commonly two vain and feigned excuſes. Some go about to excuſe them by their own frailneſs and fearfulneſs, ſaying, that they dare not read Holy Scripture, leſt through their ignorance they ſhould fall into any error. Others pretend, that the difficulty to underſtand it, and the hardneſs thereof, is ſo great, that it is meet to be read only of Clerks and learned Men. As touching the firſt: Ignorance of God's Word is the cauſe of all Error, as Chriſt himſelf affirmed to the Sadducees, ſaying that they erred, becauſe they knew not the Scripture. How ſhould they then eſchew Error, that will be ſtill ignorant? And how ſhould they come out of ignorance, that will not read nor hear that thing which ſhould give them knowledge? He that now hath moſt Knowledge was at the firſt Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant, yet he forbare not to read, for fear he ſhould fall into Error: But he diligently read, leſt he ſhould remain in Ignorance, and through Ignorance in Error. / And if you will not know the Truth of God, (a thing moſt neceſſary for you,) leſt you fall into Error, by the ſame reaſon you may then lye ſtill, and never go, leſt (if you go,) you fall into the Mire: Nor eat any good Meat, leſt you take a Surfeit, nor ſow your Corn, nor labour in your Occupation, nor uſe your Merchandiſe, for fear you loſe your Seed, your Labour, your Stock, and ſo by that reaſon, it ſhould be beſt for you to live idly, and never to take in hand to do any manner
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:54673:10"/> of good thing, leſt peradventure ſome evil thing may chance thereof. And if you be afraid to fall into Error, by reading of Holy Scripture; I ſhall ſhew you, how you may read without danger of Error. Read it humbly with a meek and lowly Heart,<note place="margin">How moſt commodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly and without all peril the Holy Scripture is to be read.</note> to the intent you may glorify God, and not yourſelf, with the knowledge of it: And read it not without daily praying to God, that he would direct your Reading to good effect: And take upon you to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound it no further, than you can plainly under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand it. For (as <hi>St. Auguſtin</hi> ſaith,) the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of Holy Scripture, is a great, large, and a high place, but the Door is very low, ſo that the high and arrogant Man cannot run in, but he muſt ſtoop low and humble himſelf, that ſhall enter into it. Preſumption and Arrogancy are the Mother of all Error; and Humility needeth to fear no Error. For Humility will only ſearch to know the Truth, it will ſearch, and will bring together one place with another, and where it cannot find out the meaning, it will pray, it will ask of others that know, and will not preſumptuouſly and raſhly define any thing which it knoweth not. Therefore the humble Man may ſearch any Truth boldly in the Scripture, without any danger of Error. And if he be ignorant, he ought the more to read and to ſearch Holy Scripture, to bring him out of Ignorance. I ſay not nay, but a Man may profit with only hearing, but he may much more profit, with both hearing and reading. This have I ſaid, as touching the fear to read, through ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance of the Perſon.<note place="margin">Scripture in ſome places is eaſie, and in ſome places hard to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood.</note> And concerning the hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Scripture, he that is ſo weak that he is not able to brook ſtrong Meat, yet he may ſuck the ſweet and tender Milk, and defer the reſt until he wax ſtronger, and come to more knowledge. For God receiveth the Learned and Unlearned, and caſteth away none, but is indifferent unto all. And the Scripture is full, as well of low Valleys, plain Ways, and eaſie for every Man to uſe, and to walk in: As alſo of high Hills and Mountains, which few Men can

For either God Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty will ſend him ſome Godly Doctor, to teach him, as he did to inſtruct the <hi>Eunuch,</hi> a Nobleman of <hi>Ethiope,</hi> and Treaſurer unto Queen <hi>Candace,</hi> who having affecton to read the Scripture, (although he underſtood it not) yet for the deſire that he had unto God's Word, God ſent his Apoſtle <hi>Philip</hi> to declare unto him the true Senſe of the Scripture that he read; or elſe, if we lack a learned Man to inſtruct and teach us, yet God himſelf from above will give light unto our Minds, and teach us thoſe things which are neceſſary for us, and wherein we be ignorant.<note place="margin">How the knowledge of the Scripture may be at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to.

He that asketh ſhall have, and he that ſeeketh ſhall find, and he that knocketh, ſhall have the Door opened. If we read once, twice, or thrice, and underſtand not, let us not ceaſe ſo, but ſtill continue Reading, Praying, Asking of others, and ſo by ſtill knocking (at the laſt) the Door ſhall be opened (as <hi>St. Auguſtin</hi> ſaith,) although many things in the Scripture be ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken in obſcure myſteries, yet there is nothing ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken under dark Myſteries in one place, but the ſelf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſame thing in other places is ſpoken more familiar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and plainly, to the capacity both of learned and unlearned.<note place="margin">No Man is excepted from the knowledge of God's Word.</note> And thoſe things in the Scripture that be plain to underſtand, and neceſſary for Salvation, every Man's Duty is to Learn them, to print them in Memory, and effectually to Exerciſe them. And as for the dark Myſteries, to be contented to be ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant in them, until ſuch time as it ſhall pleaſe God to open thoſe things unto him. In the mean ſeaſon, if he lack either aptneſs or opportunity, God will not
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:54673:11"/> impute it to his folly: But yet it behoveth not, that ſuch as be apt ſhould ſet aſide reading, becauſe ſome other be unapt to read: Nevertheleſs, for the hardneſs of ſuch places, the reading of the whole ought not to be ſet apart. And briefly to conclude,<note place="margin">What per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons would have Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance to continue.</note> (as <hi>St. Auguſtine</hi> ſaith,) by the Scripture all Men be amended, weak Men be ſtrenthened, and ſtrong Men be comforted. So that ſurely none be enemies to the reading of God's Word, but ſuch as either be ſo ignorant, that they know not how wholſome a thing it is; or elſe be ſo ſick, that they hate the moſt comfortable Medicine that ſhould heal them: Or ſo ungodly, that they would wiſh the People ſtill to continue in blindneſs and ignorance of God.</p>
                     <p>Thus we have briefly touched ſome part of the Commodities of God's Holy Word,<note place="margin">The Holy Scripture is one of God's chief Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits.</note> which is one of God's chief and principal Benefits given and declared to Mankind here on Earth.

For of ourſelves we be Crab-trees, that can bring forth no Apples. We be of ourſelves of ſuch Earth, as can but bring forth Weeds, Nettles, Brambles, Briers, Cockle and Darnel.

<pb n="20" facs="tcp:54673:17"/> and by ſhedding of his moſt precious Blood, to make a ſacrifice and ſatisfaction, or (as it may be called,) amends to his Father for our ſins, to aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwage his Wrath and Indignation conceived againſt us for the ſame.</p>

<pb n="22" facs="tcp:54673:18"/> Juſtice of God in our Juſtification, but only ſhutteth out the Juſtice of Man, that is to ſay, the Juſtice of our Works, as to be Merits of deſerving our Juſtification. And therefore <hi>St. Paul</hi> declareth here nothing upon the behalf of Man concerning his Juſtification, but only a true and lively Faith, which nevertheleſs is the Gift of God, and not Man's only Work, without God: And yet that Faith doth not ſhut out Repentance, Hope, Love, Dread, and the Fear of God, to be joyned with Faith in every Man that is juſtified, but it ſhutteth them out from the office of Juſtify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.<note place="margin">How it is to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood, that Faith juſtifieth without Works.</note> So that although they be all preſent together in him that is Juſtified, yet they juſtifie not altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: Neither doth Faith ſhut out the Juſtice of our good Works, neceſſarily to be done afterwards of Duty towards God (for we are moſt bounden to ſerve God, in doing good Deeds, commanded by him in his Holy Scripture, all the days of our Life:) But it excludeth them, ſo that we may not do them to this intent, to be made Juſt by doing of them. For all the good Works that we can do be imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, and therefore not able to deſerve our Juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation; but our Juſtification doth come freely by the mere Mercy of God; and of ſo great and free Mercy, that whereas all the World was not able of themſelves to pay any part towards their Ranſom, it pleaſed our Heavenly Father of his infinite Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, without any our deſert or deſerving, to prepare for us the moſt precious Jewels of Chriſt's Body and Blood, whereby our Ranſom might be fully paid, the Law fulfilled, and his Juſtice fully ſatisfied. So that Chriſt is now the Righteouſneſs of all them that truly do believe in him. He for them paid their Ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom by his Death. He for them fulfilled the Law in his Life.

                     <p>And <hi>St. Paul</hi> in his Epiſtle to the <hi>Galatians</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth the ſame, ſaying thus,<note place="margin">Gal. 2.</note> 
                        <hi>If there had been any Law given which could have juſtified, verily Righteouſneſs ſhould have been by the Law.</hi> And again he ſaith, <hi>If righteouſneſs be by the Law, then Chriſt died in vain.</hi> And again he ſaith;<note place="margin">Epheſ. 2.</note>

St. Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lary</hi>
                        <pb n="24" facs="tcp:54673:19"/> ſaith theſe Words plainly in the ninth Canon up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <hi>Matthew,</hi> Faith only juſtifieth. And <hi>St. Baſil</hi> a Greek Author writeth thus; This is a perfect and whole reioycing in God, when a Man advanceth not himſelf for his own Righteouſneſs, but acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth himſelf to lack true Juſtice and Righteouſneſs, and to be juſtified by the only Faith in Chriſt. And <hi>Paul</hi> (ſaith he,<note place="margin">Philip. 3.</note>) doth glory in the contempt of his own Righteouſneſs, and that he <hi>looketh for the Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs of God by Faith.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Theſe be the very words of <hi>St. Baſil,</hi> and <hi>St. Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broſe</hi> a Latin Author ſaith theſe words, This is the Ordinance of God, that they which believe in Chriſt, ſhould be ſaved without Works, by Faith only, free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly receiving remiſſion of their ſins. Conſider dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently theſe words, Without works by Faith only, freely we receive remiſſion of our ſins. What can be ſpoken more plainly, than to ſay, That freely without Works, by Faith only, we obtain remiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of our ſins? Theſe and other like Sentences, that we be juſtified by Faith only, freely, and without Works, we do read oft-times in the beſt and moſt antient Writers. As, beſide <hi>Hilary, Baſil,</hi> and <hi>St. Ambroſe</hi> before rehearſed, we read the ſame in <hi>Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gen, St. Chryſoſtom, St. Cyprian, St. Auguſtin, Proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, Oecumenius, Proclus, Bernardus, Anſelm,</hi> and many other Authors Greek and Latin. Neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs, this Sentence, that we be juſtified by Faith only, is not ſo meant of them, that the ſaid juſtifying Faith is alone in Man, without true Repentance, Hope, Charity, Dread, and the Fear of God, at any time and ſeaſon.<note place="margin">Faith a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone, how it is to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood.</note> Nor, when they ſay, that we ſhould be juſtified freely, do they mean, that we ſhould or might afterward be idle, and that nothing ſhould be required on our parts afterward: Neither do they mean, ſo to be juſtified without good Works, that we ſhould do no good Works at all; like as ſhall be more expreſſed at large hereafter. But this ſaying, That we be juſtified by Faith only, freely, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Works, is ſpoken for to take away clearly all
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:54673:19"/> Merit of our Works, as being unable to deſerve our Juſtification at God's hands, and thereby moſt plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to expreſs the Weakneſs of Man, and the Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of God, the great infirmity of ourſelves, and the Might and Power of God, the imperfection of our own Works, and the moſt abundant Grace of our Saviour Chriſt, and therefore wholly to aſcribe the merit and deſerving of our Juſtification unto Chriſt only, and his moſt precious Blood ſhedding. This Faith, the Holy Scripture teacheth us,<note place="margin">The pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit of the Doctrine of Faith only ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifieth.</note> is the ſtrong Rock and Foundation of Chriſtian Religion, this Doctrine all old and antient Authors of Chriſt's Church do approve, this Doctrine advanceth and ſetteth forth the true Glory of Chriſt, and beateth down the Vain-glory of Man; this whoſoever de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nieth, is not to be accounted for a Chriſtian Man, nor for a ſetter forth of Chriſt's Glory, but for an ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſary to Chriſt and his Goſpel, and for a ſetter forth of Mens Vain-glory.<note place="margin">What they be, that impugn the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of Faith on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth.</note> And although this Doctrine be never ſo true, (as it is moſt true indeed) that we be juſtified freely, without all merit of our own good Works, (as <hi>St. Paul</hi> doth expreſs it) and freely by this lively and perfect Faith in Chriſt only, (as the ancient Authors uſe to ſpeak it) yet this true Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine muſt be alſo truly underſtood, and moſt plainly declared, leſt carnal Men ſhould take unjuſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly occaſion thereby to live carnally, after the Appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tite and Will of the World, the Fleſh, and the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil.<note place="margin">A declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of this Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of Faith without Works ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifieth.</note> And becauſe no Man ſhould err by miſtaking of this Doctrine, I ſhall plainly and ſhortly ſo de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare the right underſtanding of the ſame, that no Man ſhall juſtly think, that he may thereby take any occaſion of carnal liberty, to follow the deſires of the fleſh; or that thereby any kind of ſin ſhall be committed, or any ungodly living the more uſed.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, you ſhall underſtand, that in our Juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion by Chriſt, it is not all one thing, the Office of God unto Man, and the Office of Man unto God. Juſtification is not the Office of Man, but of God, for Man cannot make himſelf Righteous by his own
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:54673:20"/> Works, neither in part nor in the whole, for that were the greateſt arrogancy and preſumption of Man, that Antichriſt could ſet up againſt God, to affirm, that a Man might by his own Works take away and purge his own ſins, and ſo juſtifie himſelf. But Juſtification is the Office of God only,<note place="margin">Juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is the Office of God only.</note> and is not a thing which we render unto him, but which we receive of him: Not which we give to him, but which we take of him, by his free Mercy, and by the only Merits of his moſt dearly beloved Son, our only Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer, Saviour and Juſtifier, Jeſus Chriſt: So that the true underſtanding of this Doctrine, We be ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtified freely by Faith without Works; or, that we be juſtified by Faith in Chriſt only, is not, that this our own act to Believe in Chriſt, or this our Faith in Chriſt, which is within us, doth juſtifie us, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve our Juſtification unto us, (for that were to count our ſelves to be juſtified by ſome Act or Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue that is within ourſelves,) but the true under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding and meaning thereof is, that although we hear God's Word, and believe it, although we have Faith, Hope, Charity, Repentance, Dread, and Fear of God within us, and do never ſo many Works thereunto: Yet we muſt renounce the merit of all our ſaid Virtues, of Faith, Hope, Charity, and all other Virtues and good Deeds, which we either have done, ſhall do, or can do, as things that be far too weak and inſufficient, and imperfect, to deſerve remiſſion of our Sins, and our Juſtification, and therefore we muſt truſt only in God's Mercy, and that Sacrifice which our High Prieſt and Saviour Chriſt Jeſus the Son of God once offered for us up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Croſs, to obtain thereby God's Grace and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion, as well of our original Sin in Baptiſm, as of all actual Sin committed by us after our Baptiſm, if we truly repent, and turn unfeignedly to him again. So that as <hi>St. John Baptiſt,</hi> although he were never ſo Virtuous and Godly a Man, yet in this matter of forgiving of Sin, he did put the People from him, and appointed them unto Chriſt, ſaying
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:54673:20"/> thus unto them, <hi>Behold, yonder is the Lamb of God,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">John 1.</note> 
                        <hi>which taketh away the ſins of the World:</hi> Even ſo, as Great and as Godly a Virtue as the lively Faith is, yet it putteth us from itſelf, and remitteth or ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointeth us unto Chriſt, for to have only by him re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of our Sins, or Juſtification. So that our Faith in Chriſt (as it were,) ſaith unto us thus, It is not I that taketh away your Sins, but it is Chriſt only, and to him only I ſend you for that purpoſe, forſaking therein all your good Virtues, Words, Thoughts and Works, and only putting your Truſt in Chriſt.</p>

And alſo you heard the ancient Authors Minds of this Saying, Faith in Chriſt only juſtifieth Man, ſo plainly declared, that you ſee, that the very true meaning of this Propoſition or Saying, We be juſtified by Faith in Chriſt only, (ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the meaning of the old ancient Authors,) is this: VVe put our Faith in Chriſt, that we be Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtified by him only, that we be Juſtified by God's free Mercy, and the Merits of our Saviour Chriſt only, and by no Virtue or good Works of our own that is in us, or that we can be able to have, or to do, for to deſerve the ſame: Chriſt himſelf only be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the cauſe meritorious thereof.</p>
                     <p>Here you perceive many words to be uſed to avoid contention in Words with them, that delight to brawl

Notwithſtanding, ſuch be the leſs to be paſſed upon, ſo that the reſt may profit, which will be more deſirous to know the Truth, than (when it is plain enough,) to contend about it, and with contentious and captious Cavillation to obſcure and darken it. Truth it is, that our Works do not ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifie us, to ſpeak properly of our Juſtification, (that is to ſay,) our Works do not merit or deſerve re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of our Sins, and make us, of Unjuſt, Juſt before God: But God of his own Mercy, through the only Merits and Deſervings of his Son Jeſus Chriſt doth juſtifie us. Nevertheleſs, becauſe Faith doth directly ſend us to Chriſt for remiſſion of our Sins, and that by Faith given us of God, we embrace the Promiſe of God's Mercy, and of the remiſſion of our Sins, (which thing none other of our Virtues of Works properly doth,) therefore the Scripture uſeth to ſay, That Faith without Works doth juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie. And foraſmuch as it is all one Sentence in effect, to ſay, Faith without Works, and only Faith, doth juſtifie us; therefore the old ancient Fathers of the Church from time to time have uttered our Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication with this Speech, Only Faith juſtifieth us, meaning no other thing than <hi>St. Paul</hi> meant, when he ſaid, <hi>Faith without Works juſtifieth us,</hi> And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe all this is brought to paſs, through the only Merits and Deſervings of our Saviour Chriſt, and not through our Merits, or through the Merit of any Virtue that we have within us, or of any Work that cometh from us: Therefore in that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of merit and deſerving, we forſake, (as it were,) altogether again Faith, Works, and all other Virtues. For our own Imperfection is ſo great, through the corruption of Original Sin, that all is imperfect that is within us, Faith, Charity, Hope,
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:54673:21"/> Dread, Thoughts, Words and VVorks, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore not apt to Merit and Deſerve any part of our Juſtification for us.

                     <p>Here you have heard the Office of God in our Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtification, and how we receive it of him freely, by his Mercy, without our deſerts, through true and lively Faith.

And this true Chriſtian Faith, neither any Devil hath, nor yet any Man, which in the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward profeſſion of his Mouth, and in his outward receiving of the Sacraments, in coming to the Church, and in all other outward appearances, ſeemeth to be a Chriſtian Man, and yet in his Living and Deeds ſheweth the contrary.<note place="margin">They that continue in evil living have not true Faith.</note> For how can a Man have this true Faith, ſure Truſt and Confidence in God, that by the Merits of Chriſt his Sins be forgiven, and he reconciled to the Favour of God, and to be par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taker of the Kingdom of Heaven by Chriſt, when he liveth ungodlily, and denieth Chriſt in his Deeds? Surely no ſuch ungodly Man can have this Faith and Truſt in God. For as they know Chriſt to be the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Saviour of the World; ſo they know alſo, that Wicked Men ſhall not enjoy the Kingdom of God. They know that God hateth Unrighteouſneſs,<note place="margin">Pſal. 25.</note> that he will deſtroy all thoſe that ſpeak untruly, that thoſe which have done good Works (which cannot be done without a lively Faith in Chriſt,) ſhall come forth into the Reſurrection of Life; and thoſe that have done Evil ſhall come unto the Reſurrection of Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: Very well they know alſo, that to them that be Contentious, and to them that will not be Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient unto the Truth, but will obey Unrighteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, ſhall come Indignation, Wrath, and Afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Therefore, to conclude, conſidering the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite Benefits of God, ſhewed and given unto us mercifully without our Deſerts, who hath not only Created us of Nothing; and from a piece of vile
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:54673:22"/> Clay, of his infinite Goodneſs, hath exalted us (as touching our Soul,) unto his own Similitude and Likeneſs: But alſo, whereas we were condemned to Hell, and Death everlaſting, hath given his own natural Son, being God Eternal, Immortal, and Equal unto Himſelf in Power and Glory, to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carnated, and to take our mortal Nature upon him, with the infirmities of the ſame; and in the ſame nature to ſuffer moſt ſhameful and painful Death for our Offences, to the intent to juſtifie us, and to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtore us to Life everlaſting: So making us alſo his dear Children, Brethren unto his only Son our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour Chriſt, and Inheritors for ever with him of his Eternal Kingdom of Heaven.</p>
                     <p>Theſe great and merciful Benefits of God (if they be well conſidered,) do neither miniſter unto us oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion to be idle, and to live without doing any good Works, neither yet ſtir us up by any means to do evil things: But contrariwiſe, if we be not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperate Perſons, and our Hearts harder than Stones, they move us to render ourſelves unto God wholly, with all our VVills, Hearts, Might, and Power to ſerve him in all good Deeds, obeying his Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments during our Lives, to ſeek in all things his Glory and Honour, not our ſenſual Pleaſures and Vain-glory, evermore dreading willingly to of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend ſuch a Merciful God and Loving Redeemer, in VVord, Thought, or Deed. And the ſaid Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits of God, deeply conſidered, move us for his ſake alſo to be ever ready to give ourſelves to our Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, and, as much as lieth in us, to ſtudy with all our endeavour, to do good to every Man. Theſe be the fruits of true Faith, to do good aſmuch as lieth in us to every Man, and, above all things, and in all things to advance the Glory of God, of whom only we have our Sanctification, Juſtification, Salvation, and Redemption: To whom be ever Glory, Praiſe, and Honour, VVorld without end. <hi>Amen.</hi>

                     <p>
                        <note place="margin">Faith.</note>THE Firſt coming unto God (good Chriſtian People,) is through Faith, whereby (as it is declared in the laſt Sermon,) we be Juſtified before God. And leſt any Man ſhould be deceived, for lack of right Underſtanding thereof, it is diligently to be noted, that Faith is taken in the Scripture two manner of ways.<note place="margin">A dead Faith.</note> There is one Faith, which in Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture is called a Dead Faith, which bringeth forth no good Works, but is idle, barren, and unfruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful. And this Faith, by the Holy Apoſtle <hi>St. James,</hi> is compared to the <hi>Faith of Devils,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">James 2.</note> which believe God to be True and Juſt, <hi>and tremble</hi> for fear, yet they do nothing well, but all evil. And ſuch a manner of Faith have the wicked and naughty Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian People, <hi>which confeſs God</hi> (as <hi>St. Paul</hi> ſaith,) <hi>in their mouths,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Titus 6.</note> but <hi>deny him in their deeds, being abominable, and without the right Faith, and to all good works reproveable.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And this Faith is a Perſuaſion and Belief in Man's Heart, whereby he knoweth that there is a God, and agreeth unto all Truths of God's moſt Holy Word, contained in the Holy Scripture. So that it conſiſteth only in Believing in the Word of God, that it is true. And this is not properly called Faith. But as he that readeth <hi>Caeſar</hi>'s Commentary, belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the ſame to be true, hath thereby a knowledge
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:54673:23"/> of <hi>Caeſar</hi>'s Life and notable Acts, becauſe he belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth the Hiſtory of <hi>Caeſar:</hi> Yet it is not properly ſaid, that he believeth in <hi>Caeſar,</hi> of whom he looketh for no help nor benefit. Even ſo, he that Believeth that all that is ſpoken of God in the Bible is true, and yet liveth ſo ungodly, that he cannot look to enjoy the Promiſes and Benefits of God: Although it may be ſaid, that ſuch a Man hath a Faith and Belief to the Words of God, yet it is not properly ſaid that he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieveth in God, or hath ſuch a Faith and Truſt in God, whereby he may ſurely look for Grace, Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, and everlaſting Life at God's hand; but rather for Indignation and Puniſhment, according to the Merits of his wicked Life. For as it is written in a Book, Entituled to be of <hi>Didymus Alexandrinus;</hi> Foraſmuch as Faith without Works is dead, it is not now Faith, as a dead Man is not a Man. This dead Faith therefore is not that ſure and ſubſtantial Faith which ſaveth Sinners. Another Faith there is in Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, which is not (as the aforeſaid Faith,) idle, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fruitful, and dead,<note place="margin">A lively Faith.</note> but <hi>worketh by charity</hi> (as <hi>St. Paul</hi> declareth, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.) Which as the other vain Faith is called a dead Faith, ſo may this be called a quick or lively Faith. And this is not only the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon belief of the Articles of our Faith, but it is alſo a true Truſt and Confidence of the Mercy of God, through our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, and a ſtedfaſt hope of all good things to be received at God's hand: And that although we, through Infirmity or Temptation of our Ghoſtly enemy, do fall from him by Sin, yet, if we return again unto him by true Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, that he will forgive and forget our Offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces for his Sons ſake our Saviour Jeſus Chriſt, and will make us Inheritors with him of his everlaſting Kingdom, and that in the mean time untill that Kingdom come, he will be our Protector and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fender in all perils and dangers, whatſoever do chance: And that though ſomtime he doth ſend us ſharp adverſity, yet that evermore he will be a loving Father unto us, correcting us for our Sin, but
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:54673:24"/> not withdrawing his Mercy finally from us, if we truſt in him, and commit our ſelves wholly unto him, hang only upon him, and call upon him, ready to obey and ſerve him. This is the true, lively, and unfeigned Chriſtian Faith, and is not in the Mouth and outward Profeſſion only, but it liveth, and ſtir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth inwardly in the Heart. And this Faith is not without Hope and Truſt in God; nor without the Love of God, and of our Neighbors, nor without the Fear of God, nor without the Deſire to hear God's Word, and to follow the ſame in eſchewing Evil and doing gladly all good Works.</p>
                     <p>
                        <note place="margin">Heb. 12.</note>Thus Faith (as <hi>St. Paul</hi> deſcribeth it,) is the <hi>ſure ground and foundation of the benefits which we ought to look for,</hi> and truſt to receive of God; a Certificate and ſure looking for them, although they yet ſenſibly appear not unto us. And after he ſaith, <hi>He that cometh to God muſt believe, both that he is, and that he is a merciful rewarder of Well-doers.</hi> And nothing commendeth good Men unto God, ſo much as this aſſured Faith and Truſt in him. Of this Faith, three things are ſpecially to be noted.</p>
                     <p>
                        <note place="margin">Three things are to be no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted of Faith.</note>Firſt, that this Faith doth not lye dead in the Heart, but is lively and fruitful in bringing forth good Works. Secondly, that without it can no good Works be done, that ſhall be acceptable and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant to God. Thirdly, what manner of good Works they be, that this Faith doth bring forth.</p>
                     <p>
                        <note place="margin">Faith is full of good Works.</note>For the Firſt, That as the Light cannot be hid, but will ſhew forth itſelf at one place or other: So a true Faith cannot be kept ſecret, but, when occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion is offered, it will break out, and ſhew itſelf by good Works. And as the living Body of a Man ever exerciſeth ſuch things as belong to a natural and living Body, for nouriſhment and preſervation of the ſame, as it hath need, opportunity, and oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion: Even ſo the Soul, that hath a lively Faith in it, will be doing alway ſome good Work, which ſhall declare that it is living, and will not be unoccupied. Therefore, when Men hear in the Scripture ſo high
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:54673:24"/> commendations of Faith, that it maketh us to pleaſe God, to live with God, and to be the Children of God: If then they fancy, that they be ſet at liberty from doing all good Works, and may live as they liſt, they trifle with God, and deceive themſelves. And it is a manifeſt token, that they be far from having the true and lively Faith; and alſo far from Knowledge, what true Faith meaneth. For the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſure and lively Chriſtian Faith is, not only to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve all things of God which are contained in Holy Scripture, but alſo is an earneſt Truſt and Confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence in God, that he doth regard us, and that he is careful over us, as the Father is over the Child whom he doth love, and that he will be merciful unto us for his only Sons ſake, and that we have our Saviour Chriſt our perpetual Advocate, and Prieſt, in whoſe only Merits, Oblation, and Suffering, we do truſt that our Offences be continually waſhed and purged, whenſoever we (repenting truly,) do return to him with our whole Heart, ſtedfaſtly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termining with ourſelves, through his Grace, to obey and ſerve him in keeping his Commandments, and never to turn back again to Sin. Such is the true Faith, that the Scripture doth ſo much com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend, the which when it ſeeth and conſidereth what God hath done for us, is alſo moved through continual aſſiſtance of the Spirit of God, to ſerve and pleaſe him, to keep his Favour, to fear his Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſure, to continue his Obedient Children, ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Thakfulneſs again by obſerving or keeping his Commandments, and that freely, for true Love chiefly, and not for dread of Puniſhment, or love of temporal Reward, conſidering how clearly; without deſervings, we have received his Mercy and Pardon freely.</p>
                     <p>This true Faith will ſhew forth itſelf, and cannot long be idle: For as it is written,<note place="margin">Abac 2</note> 
                        <hi>The Juſt man doth live by his Faith.</hi> He never ſleepeth, nor is idle, when he would wake and be well occupied. And God by his Prophet <hi>Jeremy</hi> ſaith,<note place="margin">Jer. 17.</note> That <hi>he is a
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:54673:25"/> happy and bleſſed man, which hath Faith and confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence in God.</hi> For he is like a Tree ſet by the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter-ſide, and ſpreadeth his roots abroad towards the moiſture, and feareth not heat when it cometh, his leaf will be green, and will not ceaſe to bring forth his Fruit: Even ſo, Faithful men (putting away all fear of Adverſity,) will ſhew forth the fruit of their good Works, as occaſion is offered to do them.</p>

                     <p>YE have heard in the Firſt Part of this Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, that there be two kinds of Faith, a dead and an unfruitful Faith, and a Faith lively that worketh by Charity.

For if we do not ſhew ourſelves faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful in our Converſation, the Faith which we pretend to have, is but a feigned Faith: Becauſe the true Chriſtian Faith is manifeſtly ſhewed by good Living, and not by VVords only, as <hi>St. Auguſtin</hi> ſaith, Good Living cannot be ſeparated from true Faith, which worketh by Love.<note place="margin">Libro de fide &amp; operibus. cap. 2.

Gen. 11.</note> And <hi>St. Chryſoſtome</hi> ſaith, Faith of itſelf is full of good VVorks: As ſoon as a Man doth Believe, he ſhall be garniſhed with them. How plentiful this Faith is of good VVorks, and how it maketh the work of one Man more acceptable to God, than of another, <hi>St. Paul</hi> teacheth at large in the Eleventh Chapter to the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> ſaying, <hi>That faith made the oblation of</hi> Abel <hi>better than the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of</hi> Cain. This made <hi>Noah to build the Ark.</hi> This made <hi>Abraham to forſake his Country and all his Friends, and go into a far Country,</hi> there to dwell
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:54673:25"/> among Strangers. So did alſo <hi>Iſaac</hi> and <hi>Jacob,</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pending or hanging only on the Help and Truſt that they had in God. And when they came to the Country which God promiſed them, they would build no Cities, Towns, nor Houſes, but lived like Strangers in Tents, that might every day be remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved. Their Truſt was ſo much in God, that they ſet but little by any worldly thing; for that God had prepared better Dwelling-places for them in Heaven of his own Foundation and Building.<note place="margin">Gen. 22. Eccl. 13.</note> This Faith made <hi>Abraham</hi> ready, at God's Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, to offer his own Son and Heir <hi>Iſaac,</hi> whom he loved ſo well, and by whom he was promiſed to have innumerable iſſue; among the which, One ſhould be Born, in <hi>whom all Nations ſhould be bleſſed,</hi> tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting ſo much in God, that, though he were ſlain, yet that God was able by his Omnipotent Power to raiſe him from Death, and perform his Promiſe. <hi>He miſtruſted not the promiſe of God,</hi> although unto his Reaſon every thing ſeemeth contrary. He Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved verily, that God would not forſake him in Dearth and Famine that was in the Country. And in all other dangers that he was brought unto, he truſted ever that God ſhould be his God, and his Protector and Defender, whatſoever he ſaw to the contrary. This Faith wrought ſo in the Heart of <hi>Moſes,</hi> that <hi>he refuſed to be taken for King Pharaoh,</hi>

                     </p>
                     <p>All theſe Fathers, Martyrs, and other Holy Men; (whom <hi>St. Paul</hi> ſpake of) had their Faith ſurely fix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in God, when all the World was againſt them. They did not only know God to be the Lord, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker, and Governor of all Men in the World: But alſo they had a ſpecial Confidence and Truſt, that he was, and would be, their God, their Comforter, Aider, Helper, Maintainer and Defender. This is the Chriſtian Faith which theſe Holy Men had, and we alſo ought to have. And although they were not named Chriſtian Men, yet was it a Chriſtian Faith that they had, for they looked for all Benefits of God the Father, through the Merits of his Son Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſu Chriſt, as we now do. This difference is between them and us, that they looked when Chriſt ſhould come, and we be in the time when he is come. Therefore ſaith <hi>St. Auguſtine,</hi>

But now by the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming of our Saviour Chriſt, we have received more abundantly the Spirit of God in our Hearts, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by we may conceive a greater Faith, and a ſurer Truſt than many of them had. But in effect they and we be all one: We have the ſame Faith that they had in God, and they the ſame that we have. And <hi>St. Paul</hi> ſo much extolleth their Faith, becauſe we ſhould not leſs, but rather more, give our ſelves whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly unto Chriſt, both in Profeſſion and Living, now when Chriſt is come, than the old Fathers did before his coming. And by all the Declaration of <hi>St. Paul,</hi> it is evident, that the true, lively, and Chriſtian Faith, is no dead, vain, or unfruitful thing, but a thing of perfect Virtue, of wonderful Operation or Working, and Strength, bringing forth all good Motions and good Works.</p>
                     <p>All Holy Scripture agreeably beareth witneſs, that a true lively Faith in Chriſt doth bring forth good VVorks: And therefore every Man muſt examine, and try himſelf diligently, to know whether he have the ſame true lively Faith in his Heart unfeignedly, or not, which he ſhall know by the fruits thereof. Many that profeſſed the Faith of Chriſt were in this error, that they thought they knew God, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved in him, when in their Life they declared the contrary; VVhich error <hi>St. John</hi> in his Firſt Epiſtle confuting, writeth in this wiſe,<note place="margin">1 John 2.</note> 
                        <hi>Hereby we are cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified, that we knew God, if we obſerve his Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.

                        <note place="margin">1 John 3.</note> 
                        <hi>For if our own hearts reprove us, God is above our hearts, and knoweth all things. Welbeloved, if our hearts reprove us not, then have we confidence in God, and
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:54673:27"/> ſhall have of him whatſoever we ask, becauſe we keep his Commandments, and do thoſe things that pleaſe him.</hi> And yet further he ſaith, <hi>Every man that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieveth that Jeſus is Chriſt, is born of God, and we know that whoſoever is born of God doth not ſin: But he that is begotten of God purgeth himſelf, and the Devil doth not touch him.</hi> And finally he conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth, and ſheweth the cauſe why he wrote this Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle,<note place="margin">1 John 5.</note> ſaying, <hi>For this cauſe have I thus written unto you, that you may know that you have everlaſting life, which do believe in the Son of God.</hi> And in his third Epiſtle, he confirmeth the whole matter of Faith and VVorks in few words,<note place="margin">3 John 1.</note> ſaying, <hi>He that doth well is of God, and he that doth evil knoweth not God.</hi> And as <hi>St. John</hi> ſaith, That as the lively Knowledge and Faith of God bringeth forth good VVorks: So ſaith he likewiſe of Hope and Charity, That they cannot ſtand with evil living.

                     <head>The Third Part of the Sermon of Faith.</head>
                     <p>YOu have heard in the Second Part of this Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, that no Man ſhould think, that he hath that lively Faith which Scripture commandeth, when he liveth not obediently to God's Laws, for all good Works ſpring out of that Faith: And alſo it hath been declared unto you by examples, that Faith ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth Men ſtedfaſt, quiet and patient in all afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Now as concerning the ſame matter, you ſhall hear what followeth. A Man may ſoon deceive him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and think in his own phantaſie, that he by Faith knoweth God, loveth him, feareth him, and belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to him, when in very deed he doth nothing leſs. For the tryal of all theſe things is a very Godly and Chriſtian Life. He that feeleth his Heart ſet to ſeek God's Honour, and ſtudieth to know the Will and Commandments of God, and to frame himſelf there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto, and leadeth not his Life after the deſire of his own fleſh, to ſerve the Devil by Sin, but ſetteth his Mind to ſerve God for his own ſake, and for his ſake alſo to love all his Neighbors, whether they be Friends or Adverſaries, doing good to every Man, (as oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity ſerveth) and willingly hurting no Man: Such a Man may well rejoyce in God, perceiving by the trade of his Life, that he unfeignedly hath the right knowledge of God, a lively Faith, a ſtedfaſt Hope, a true and unfeigned Love, and Fear of God. But he that caſteth away the yoke of God's Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments from his Neck, and giveth himſelf to live without true Repentance, after his own ſenſual Mind and Pleaſure, not regarding to know God's Word, and much leſs to live according thereunto: Such a Man clearly deceiveth himſelf, and ſeeth not his own Heart, if he thinketh that he either knoweth God, loveth him, feareth him, or truſteth in him. Some peradventure fancy in themſelves, that they belong to
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:54673:28"/> God; although they live in Sin, and ſo they come to the Church, and ſhew themſelves as God's dear Children. But <hi>St. John</hi> ſaith plainly, <hi>If we ſay,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">1 John 1.</note> 
                        <hi>that we have any company with God, and walk in darkneſs, we do lye.</hi> Others do vainly think, that they know and love God, although they paſs not of the Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. But <hi>St. John</hi> ſaith clearly,<note place="margin">1 John 2.</note> 
                        <hi>He that ſaith I know God, and keepeth not his Commandments, he is a lyar.</hi> Some falſly perſuade themſelves, that they love God, when they hate their Neighbors. But <hi>St. John</hi> ſaith manifeſtly, <hi>If any man ſay I love God,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">1 John 4. 1 John 2.</note> 
                        <hi>and yet hateth his Brother, he is a lyar. He that ſaith, that he is in the light, and hateth his brother, he is ſtill in darkneſs. He that loveth his brother dwelleth in the light, but he that hateth his brother is in darkneſs, and walketh in darkneſs, and know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>e h not whither he goeth: For darkneſs hath blinded h s eyes.</hi> And moreover he ſaith,<note place="margin">1 John 3.</note> 
                        <hi>Hereby we mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>f ſtly know the Children of God from the Children of the Devil. He that doth not righteouſly is not the child of God, nor he that hateth his Brother.</hi> De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive not yourſelves therefore, thinking that you have Faith in God, or that you love God, or do truſt in him, or do fear him, when you live in ſin: For then your ungodly and ſinful Life declareth the contrary, whatſoever you ſay or think. It pertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to a Chriſtian Man to have this true Chriſtian Faith, and to try himſelf whether he hath it or no, and to know what belongeth to it, and how it doth work in him. It is not the World that we can truſt to, the World, and all that is therein, is but vanity. It is God that muſt be our Defence and Protection againſt all temptation of Wickedneſs and Sin, Errors, Superſtition, Idolatry, and all Evil. If all the World were on our ſide, and God againſt us, What could the World avail us? Therefore let us ſet our whole Faith and Truſt in God, and neither the World, the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil, nor all the power of them ſhall prevail againſt us. Let us therefore (good Chriſtian Poople,) try and examine our Faith, what it is: Let us not flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:54673:29" rendition="simple:additions"/> our ſelves, but look upon our Works, and ſo judge of our Faith what it is. Chriſt himſelf ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth of this matter,<note place="margin">Luke 6.</note> and ſaith, <hi>The tree is known by the fruit.</hi> Therefore let us do good Works, and thereby declare our Faith to be the lively Chriſtian Faith. Let us by ſuch Virtues as ought to ſpring out of Faith, ſhew our election to be ſure and ſtable, as <hi>St. Peter</hi> teacheth,<note place="margin">2 Pet. 1.</note> 
                        <hi>endeavour yourſelves to make your calling and election certain by good Works.</hi> And alſo he ſaith, <hi>miniſter or declare in your faith virtue, in virtue knowledge, in knowledge temperance, in tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perance patience, in patience godlineſs, in godlineſs brotherly charity, in brotherly charity love:</hi> So ſhall we ſhew indeed, that we have the very lively Chriſtian Faith, and may ſo both certifie our Conſcience the better that we be in the right Faith; and alſo by theſe means confirm other Men. If theſe fruits do not follow, we do but mock with God, deceive our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and alſo other Men. Well may we bear the name of Chriſtian Men, but we do lack the true Faith that doth belong thereunto, for the true Faith doth ever bring forth good Works, as <hi>St. James</hi> ſaith,<note place="margin">James 2.</note> 
                        <hi>Shew me thy faith by thy deeds.</hi> Thy Deeds and Works muſt be an open Teſtimonial of thy Faith: Otherwiſe thy Faith (being without good VVorks,) is but the Devils Faith, the Faith of the wicked, a phantaſie of Faith, and not a true Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Faith. And like as the Devils and evil Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple be nothing the better for their counterfeit Faith, but it is unto them the more cauſe of damnation: So they that be Chriſtians and have received knowledge of God, and of Chriſt's Merits, and yet of a ſet pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe do live idly, without good VVorks, thinking the name of a naked Faith to be either ſufficient for them, or elſe ſetting their Minds upon vain pleaſures of this VVorld, do live in Sin without Repentance, not uttering the fruits that do belong to ſuch an high Profeſſion; upon ſuch preſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious Perſons, and wilful Sinners, muſt needs remain the great vengeance of God, and eternal puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:54673:29"/> in Hell, prepared for the unjuſt and wicked Livers. Therefore as you profeſs the name of Chriſt, (good Chriſtian People,) let no ſuch phantaſie and imagination of Faith at any time beguile you: But be ſure of your Faith, try it by your living, look upon the fruits that come of it, mark the increaſe of Love and Charity by it towards God and your Neighbor, and ſo ſhall you perceive it to be a true lively Faith. If you feel and perceive ſuch a Faith in you, rejoyce in it, and be diligent to maintain it, and keep it ſtill in you, let it be daily increaſing, and more and more by well-working, and ſo ſhall you be ſure that you ſhall pleaſe God by this Faith; and at the length (as other faithful Men have done before) ſo ſhall you (when his Will is,) come to him, and receive <hi>the end and final reward of your Faith,</hi> (as <hi>St. Peter</hi> nameth it,) <hi>the ſalvation of your Souls:</hi>

                  <div n="1" type="part">
                     <p>IN the laſt Sermon was declared unto you, what the lively and true Faith of a Chriſtian Man is, that it cauſeth not a Man to be idle, but to be occupied in bringing forth good Works,<note place="margin">No good Works can be done without Faith. John 15.</note> as occaſion ſerveth.</p>
                     <p>Now by God's Grace ſhall be declared the Second thing that before was noted of Faith, that without it can no good Work be done, accepted and pleaſant unto God. <hi>For as a branch cannot bear fruit of it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,</hi> (ſaith our Saviour Chriſt,) <hi>except it abide in the Vine; ſo cannot you, except you abide in me. I am the Vine, and you are the branches, he that abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth in me, and I in him, he bringeth forth much fruit; for without me you can do nothing.</hi> And <hi>St. Paul</hi> proveth, that the Eunuch had Faith, becauſe he pleaſed God.<note place="margin">Heb. 11.</note> 
                        <hi>For without Faith</hi> (ſaith he,) <hi>it is not poſſible to pleaſe God.</hi> And again to the <hi>Romans</hi> he ſaith,<note place="margin">Rom. 14.</note> 
                        <hi>Whatſoever work is done without faith, it is ſin.</hi> Faith giveth life to the Soul, and they be as much dead to God that lack Faith, as they be to the World, whoſe Bodies lack Souls. Without Faith all that is done of us is but dead before God, although the work ſeem never ſo gay and glorious before Man. Even as the Picture, graven or painted, is but a dead repreſentation of the thing itſelf, and is without life, or any manner of moving: So be the Works of all unfaithful Perſons before God. They do appear to be lively Works, and indeed they be but dead, not availing to the everlaſting life. They be but ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows and ſhews of lively and good things, and not
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:54673:30" rendition="simple:additions"/> good and lively things indeed. For true Faith doth give life to the Works, and out of ſuch Faith come good Works, that be very good Works indeed, and without Faith no Work is good before God, as ſaith <hi>St. Auguſtine.</hi>
                        <note place="margin">In Praefat. Pſal. 13.</note> We muſt ſet no good Works before Faith, nor think that before Faith a Man may do any good VVorks, for ſuch VVorks, although they ſeem unto Men to be praiſe-worthy, yet indeed they be but vain, and not allowed before God. They be as the Courſe of an Horſe that runneth out of the way, which taketh great labour, but to no purpoſe. Let no Man therefore (ſaith he,) reckon upon his good Works before his Faith: VVhereas Faith was not, good VVorks were not. The intent (ſaith he,) maketh good VVorks, but Faith muſt guide and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the intent of Man. And Chriſt ſaith,<note place="margin">Matth. 6. In Praefat. Pſal. 31.</note> 
                        <hi>If thine eye be naught, thy whole body is full of darkneſs.</hi> The Eye doth ſignifie the intent, (ſaith <hi>St. Auguſtine,</hi>) wherewith a Man doth a thing. So that he which doth not his good VVorks with a godly intent, and a true Faith, that worketh by Love, the whole Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy beſide, (that is to ſay,) all the whole number of his Works, is dark, and there is no light in them. For good Deeds be not meaſured by the Facts them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and ſo diſcerned from Vices, but by the ends and intents for the which they were done. If a Heathen Man cloath the Naked, feed the Hungry, and do ſuch other like Works; yet becauſe he doth them not in Faith, for the Honour and Love of God, they be but dead, vain, and fruitleſs Works to him. Faith it is, that doth commend the Work to God: For (as <hi>St. Auguſtine</hi> ſaith,) whether thou wilt or no, that Work that cometh not of Faith is naught: Where the Faith of Chriſt is not the foundation, there is no good Work, what Building ſoever we make. There is one Work, in the which be all good Works, that is, Faith, which worketh by Charity: If thou have it, thou haſt the ground of all good Works. For the virtues of Strength, Wiſdom, Temperance and Juſtice, be all referred unto this ſame Faith. With<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:54673:31" rendition="simple:additions"/> this Faith we have not them, but only the names and ſhadows of them, (as <hi>St. Auguſtine</hi> ſaith.) All the life of them that lack the true Faith, is Sin, and nothing is Good without him that is the Author of Goodneſs: Where he is not, there is but feigned Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, although it be in the beſt VVorks, And <hi>St. Auguſtine,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">De vocati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>one Genti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um lib. cap. 3.</note> declaring this Verſe of the <hi>Pſalm,</hi> The Turtle hath found a neſt where ſhe may keep her young Birds, ſaith, that Jews, Hereticks, and Pagans do good VVorks, they cloath the Naked, feed the Poor, and do other good works of Mercy: But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they be not done in the true Faith, therefore the Birds be loſt. But if they remain in Faith, then Faith is the neſt and ſafeguard of their Birds, that is to ſay, ſafeguard of their good VVorks, that the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward of them be not utterly loſt. And this matter (which <hi>St. Auguſtine</hi> at large in many Books diſpu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth) <hi>St. Ambroſe</hi> concludeth in few words, ſaying, He that by nature would withſtand Vice, either by natural VVill or Reaſon, he doth in vain garniſh the time of this Life, and attaineth not the very true Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues: For without the worſhipping of the true God, that which ſeemeth to be Virtue is Vice. And yet moſt plainly to this purpoſe writeth <hi>St. Chryſoſtome</hi> in this wife;<note place="margin">In Sermo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne de ſide, lege, &amp; ſpiritu Sancto.</note> You ſhall find many which have not the true Faith, that be not of the flock of Chriſt, and yet (as it appeareth) they flouriſh in good works of Mercy: You ſhall find them full of Pity, Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion, and given to Juſtice; and yet for all that, they have no fruit of their VVorks, becauſe the chief VVork lacketh. For when the Jews asked of Chriſt, what they ſhould do to work good VVorks: He anſwer'd,<note place="margin">John 6.</note> 
                        <hi>This is the work of God, to believe in him whom he ſent:</hi> So that he called Faith the VVork of God. And as ſoon as a Man hath Faith, anon he ſhall flouriſh in good VVorks: For Faith of itſelf is full of good Works, and nothing is good without Faith. And for a ſimilitude, he ſaith, That they, which gliſter and ſhine in good Works without Faith in God, be like dead Men, which have goodly
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:54673:31"/> and precious Tombs, and yet it availeth them no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing. Faith may not be naked without good Works, for then it is no true Faith; And when it is adjoyned to Works, yet it is above the Works. For as Men that be very Men indeed, firſt have life, and after be nouriſhed: So muſt our Faith in Chriſt go before, and after be nouriſhed with good Works. And life may be without nouriſhment, but nouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment cannot be without life. A Man muſt needs be nou<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>riſhed by good Works, but firſt he muſt have Faith. He that doth good Deeds, yet without Faith, he hath no Life. I can ſhew a Man that by Faith without Works lived, and came to Heaven: But without Faith, never Man had Life. The Thief that was hanged, when Chriſt ſuffer'd, did Believe only, and the moſt merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful God juſtified him. And becauſe no Man ſhall ſay a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>again, that he lacked time to do good Works, for elſe he would have done them: Truth it is, and I will not contend therein, but this I will ſurely affirm, That Faith only ſaved him. If he had lived, and not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded Faith, and the Works thereof, he ſhould have loſt his Salvation again. But this is the effect that I ſay, That Faith by itſelf ſaved him, but Works by themſelves never juſtified any Man. Here ye have heard the Mind of <hi>St. Chryſostome,</hi> whereby you may perceive, that neither Faith is without Works, (having opportunity thereto,) nor Works can avail to everlaſting Life, without Faith.</p>

Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto Chriſt made him a plain anſwer, rehearſing the Commandments of God, ſaying, <hi>Thou ſhalt not kill; Thou ſhalt not commit adultery;</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Matth. 19.</note> 
                        <hi>Thou ſhalt not ſteal; Thou ſhalt not bear falſe witneſs, Honour thy Father and thy Mother, and love thy neighbor as thyſelf.</hi> By which words Chriſt declared,<note place="margin">The Works that lead to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, be Works of God's Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.

So that this is to be taken for a moſt true Leſſon taught by Chriſt's own Mouth, That the works of the Moral Commandments of God be the very true Works of Faith, which lead to the Bleſſed Life to come. But the blindneſs and malice of Man, even from the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning, hath ever been ready to fall from God's Commandments.

For not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding all the Benefits of God ſhewed unto the People of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> yet when <hi>Moſes</hi> went up into the Mountain to ſpeak with Almighty God, he had tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried there but a few days, when the People began to invent new Gods.

This arrogancy God deteſted, that Man ſhould ſo advance his Laws, to make them equal with God's Laws, wherein the true honouring and right worſhipping of God ſtandeth, and to make his Laws for them to be left off. God hath appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his Laws, whereby his pleaſure is to be honoured. His pleaſure is alſo, That all Mens Laws, not being contrary unto his Laws, ſhall be obeyed and kept, as good and neceſſary for every Commonweal, but not as things wherein principally his Honour reſteth: And all Civil and Man's Laws, either be, or ſhould
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:54673:34"/> be made, to bring Men the better to keep God's Laws, that conſequently, or followingly, God ſhould be the better honoured by them. Howbeit, the Scribes and Phariſes were not content, that their Laws ſhould be no higher eſteemed than other poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive and Civil Laws; nor would they have them cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led by the name of other temporal Laws, but called them Holy and Godly Traditions,<note place="margin">Holy Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions were eſteemed as God's Laws.</note> and would have them eſteemed, not only for a right and true wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipping of God, (as God's Laws be indeed,) but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo for the moſt high honouring of God, to the which the Commandments of God ſhould give place. And for this cauſe did Chriſt ſo vehemently ſpeak againſt them, ſaying, Your Traditions, which Men eſteem ſo high,<note place="margin">Holineſs of Man's device, is commonly occaſion that God is offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded. Matth. 12.</note> be abomination before God. For commonly of ſuch Traditions, followeth the tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion or breaking of God's Commandments, and a more Devotion in keeping of ſuch things, and a greater Conſcience in breaking of them, than of the Commandments of God. As the Scribes and Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſes ſo ſuperſtitiouſly, and ſcrupulouſly kept the Sabbath, that they were offended with Chriſt, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he healed ſick Men; and with his Apoſtles, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they being ſore a hungry, gathered the ears of Corn to eat upon that day; and becauſe his Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples waſhed not their Hands ſo often as their Tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions required: The Scribes and Phariſees quarrelled with Chriſt,<note place="margin">Matth. 15.</note> ſaying, <hi>Why do thy Diſciples break the traditions of the Seigniours?</hi> But Chriſt laid to their charge, that they, for to keep their own Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions, did teach Men to break the very Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments of God. For they taught the People ſuch a Devotion, that they offered their Goods into the Treaſure-houſe of the Temple, under the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of God's Honour, leaving their Fathers and Mothers (to whom they were chiefly bound,) un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holpen, and ſo they brake the Commandments of God, to keep their own Traditions. They eſteem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed more an Oath made by the Gold, or Oblation in the Temple, than an Oath made in the Name of
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:54673:34"/> God himſelf, or of the Temple. They were more ſtudious to pay their Tithes of ſmall things, than to do the greater things commanded of God, as Works of Mercy, or to do Juſtice, or to deal ſincerely, uprightly, and faithfully with God and Man. <hi>Theſe</hi> (ſaith Chriſt,) <hi>ought to be done,</hi>

                        <hi>and the other not left undone.</hi> And to be ſhort, they were of ſo blind Judgment, that they ſtumbled at a ſtraw, and leaped over a block. They would (as it were,) nicely take a Fly out of their Cup, and drink down a whole Camel. And therefore Chriſt called them <hi>Blind guides,</hi> warning his Diſciples from time to time to eſchew their Doctrine. For although they ſeemed to the World to be moſt perfect Men, both in Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving and Teaching, yet was their Life but Hypocri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie, and their Doctrine but ſower Leaven, mingled with Superſtition, Idolatry, and overthwart Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, ſetting up the Traditions and Ordinances of Man, inſtead of God's Commandments.</p>

                     <p>THat all Men might rightly judge of Good Works, it hath been declared in the Second Part of this Sermon, what kind of Good Works they be, that God would have his People to walk in, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, ſuch as he hath commanded in his Holy Scripture, and not ſuch Works as Men have ſtudied out of their own Brain, of a blind Zeal and Devotion, without the Word of God: And by miſtaking the nature of good Works, Man hath moſt highly diſpleaſed God, and hath gone from his Will and Commandments. So that thus you have heard how much the World from the beginning, until Chriſt's time, was ever rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to fall from the Commandments of God, and to ſeek other means to Honour and Serve him, after a Devotion found out of their own Heads: And how they did ſet up their own Traditions, as high, or
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:54673:35"/> above God's Commandments, which hath hapned alſo in our times, (the more it is to be lamented,) no leſs than it did among the <hi>Jews,</hi> and that by the corruption, or at leaſt by the negligence of them that chiefly ought to have preſerved the Pure and Heavenly Doctrine left by Chriſt. What Man ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving any Judgment or Learning, joyned with a true Zeal unto God, doth not ſee, and lament, to have entred into Chriſt's Religion ſuch falſe Doctrine, Superſtition, Idolatry, Hypocriſie, and other enor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities and abuſes, ſo as by little and little, through the ſower Leaven thereof, the ſweet Bread of God's Holy Word hath been much hindred and laid apart? Neither had the <hi>Jews</hi> in their moſt blindneſs ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Pilgrimages unto Images, nor uſed ſo much kneeling, kiſſing, and cenſing of them, as hath been uſed in our time:<note place="margin">Sects and Religions amongſt Chriſtian Men.</note> Sects and feigned Religions were neither the fortieth part ſo many among the <hi>Jews,</hi> nor more ſuperſtitiouſly and ungodlily abuſed, than of late days they have been among us. Which Sects and Religions had ſo many hypocritical and feigned Works in their ſtate of Religion, (as they arrogant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly named it,) that their Lamps (as they ſaid) ran always over, able to ſatisfie, not only for their own Sins, but alſo for all other their Benefactors, Brothers, and Siſters of Religion, as moſt ungodlily and craftily they had perſuaded the multitude of ignorant Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple: Keeping in divers places (as it were) Marts or Markets of Merits, being full of their Holy Reliques, Images, Shrines, and Works of overflowing abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance ready to be ſold, and all things which they had were called Holy, Holy Cowls, Holy Girdles, Holy Pardons, Beads, Holy Shooes, Holy Rules, and all full of Holineſs. And what thing can be more foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh, more ſuperſtitious, or ungodly, than that Men, Women, and Children, ſhould wear a Friers Coat, to deliver them from Agues, or Peſtilence? Or when they Dye, or when they be Buried, cauſe it to be caſt upon them, in hope thereby to be ſaved? Which Superſtition, although (Thanks be to God,) it hath
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:54673:35"/> been little uſed in this Realm, yet in divers other Realms it hath been, and yet is uſed among many, both learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and unlearned. But to paſs over the innumerable Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtitiouſneſs that hath been in ſtrange Apparel, in Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, in Dormitory, in Cloiſter, in Chapter, in choice of meats and drinks, and in ſuch like things; let us conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, what enormities and abuſes have been in the three chief principal points, which they called the three Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentials, or three chief Foundations, of Religion, that is to ſay, Obedience, Chaſtity, and wilful Poverty.</p>
                     <p>Firſt,<note place="margin">The three chief vows of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion.</note> under pretence or colour of Obedience to their Father in Religion, (which Obedience they made themſelves,) they were made free by their Rule and Canons, from the Obedience of their natural Father and Mother, and from the Obedience of Emperor and King, and all temporal Power, whom, of very Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty by God's Laws they were bound to obey. And ſo the profeſſion of their Obedience not due was a for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaking of their due Obedience. And how their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of Chaſtity was kept, it is more honeſty to paſs over in ſilence, and let the World judge of that which is well known, than with unchaſte Words, by expreſſing of their unchaſte Life, to offend Chaſte and Godly Ears. And as for their wilful Poverty, it was ſuch, that when in Poſſeſſions, Jewels, Plate, and Riches, they were equal, or above Merchants, Gentlemen, Barons, Earls, and Dukes: Yet by this ſubtil ſophiſtical term, <hi>Proprium in commune,</hi> that is to ſay, Proper in common, they mocked the World, perſuading, that notwithſtanding all their Poſſeſſions and Riches, yet they kept their Vow, and were in wilful Poverty. But for all their Riches, they might neither help Father or Mother, nor other that were indeed very needy and poor, without the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence of their Father Abbot, Prior, or Warden, and yet they might take of every Man, but they might not give ought to any Man, no, not to them whom the Laws of God bound them to help. And ſo through their Traditions and Rules, the Laws of God could bear no rule with them. And therefore
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:54673:36"/> of them might be moſt truly ſaid, that which Chriſt ſpake unto the Phariſes,<note place="margin">Matth. 15.</note> 
                        <hi>You break the Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of God by your Traditions: You honour God with your lips, but your hearts be far from him.</hi> And the longer Prayers they uſed by day and by night, under pretence or colour of ſuch Holineſs, to get the favour of Widows, and other ſimple folks, that they might ſing Trentals and Service for their Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands and Friends, and admit, or receive them into their Prayers: The more truly is verified of them the Saying of Chriſt,<note place="margin">Matth. 23.</note> 
                        <hi>Wo be unto you Scribes and Phari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, Hypocrites, for you devour Widows houſes, under colour of long Prayers, therefore your damnation ſhall be the greater.

Which, although it were before God moſt abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable, and contrary to God's Commandments and Chriſt's pure Religion; yet it was praiſed to be a moſt Godly life, and higheſt ſtate of perfection: As though a Man might be more Godly, and more perfect, by keeping the Rules,<note place="margin">Other De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices and Superſtiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous.</note> Traditions, and Profeſſions of Men, than by keeping the Holy Commandments of God. And briefly to paſs over the ungodly and
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:54673:36"/> counterfeit Religion; let us rehearſe ſome other kinds of Papiſtical Superſtitions and Abuſes, as of Beads, of Lady Pſalters, and Roſaries, of fifteen Oes, of <hi>St. Bernard's</hi> Verſes, of <hi>St. Agathe</hi>'s Letters, of Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatory, of Maſſes ſatisfactory, of Stations and Jubi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lees, of feigned Reliques, of hallowed Beads, Bells, Bread, Water, Pſalms, Candles, Fire, and ſuch other: Of Superſtitious Faſtings, of Fraternities or Brother<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoods, of Pardons, with ſuch like Merchandiſe, which were ſo eſteemed and abuſed to the great pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice of God's Glory and Commandments; that they were made moſt High and moſt Holy things, whereby to attain to the everlaſting Life, or remiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Sin: Yea alſo, vain Inventions, unfruitful Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies, and ungodly Laws, Decrees,<note place="margin">Decrees and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretals.</note> and Councils of <hi>Rome,</hi> were in ſuch wiſe advanced, that nothing was thought comparable in Authority, Wiſdom, Learning, and Godlineſs, unto them. So that the Laws of <hi>Rome</hi> (as they ſaid,) were to be received of all Men, as the four Evangeliſts, to the which all Laws of Princes muſt give place. And the Laws of God alſo partly were left off, and leſs eſteemed, that the ſaid Laws, Decrees and Councils, with their Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions and Ceremonies, might be more duly kept, and had in greater reverence. Thus was the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, through ignorance, ſo blinded, with the Godly ſhew and appearance of thoſe things, that they thought the keeping of them to be a more Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, a more perfect Service and Honouring of God, and more pleaſing to God, than the keeping of God's Commandments. Such hath been the corrupt inclination of Man, ever Superſtitiouſly given to make new Honouring of God on his own Head, and then to have more Affection and Devotion to keep that, than to ſearch out God's Holy Commandments, and to keep them. And furthermore, to take God's Commandments for Men's Commandments, and Men's Commandments for God's Commandments; yea, and for the higheſt and moſt Perfect and Holieſt of all God's Commandments. And ſo was all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed,
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:54673:37"/> that ſcant well learned Men, and but a ſmall number of them knew, or, at the leaſt, would know, and durſt affirm the Truth, to ſeparate or ſever God's Commandments from the Commandments of Men.

Of the love of God he taught on this wife unto a Doctor of the Law, that asked him, which was the great and chief Commandment in the Law. <hi>Love thy Lord God,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Matth. 22.</note> (ſaid Chriſt,) <hi>with all thy heart, with all thy ſoul, and with all thy mind.</hi> And of the love that we ought to have among ourſelves each to other, he teacheth us thus, You have heard it taught in times paſt,<note place="margin">Matth. 5. Matth. 5.</note> 
                        <hi>Thou ſhalt love thy friend, and have thy foe; But I tell you, love your enemies, ſpeak well of them that defame and ſpeak evil of you, do well to them that hate you, pray for them that vex and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecute you, that you may be the children of your father that is in Heaven. For he maketh his Sun to riſe both upon the evil and good, and ſendeth rain to the juſt and unjuſt. For if you love them that love you, What reward ſhall you have? Do not the Publicans likewiſe? And if you ſpeak well only of them that be your brethren, and dearly beloved friends, what great
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:54673:38"/> matter is that? Do not the Heathen the ſame alſo?</hi> Theſe be the very words of our Saviour Chriſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, touching the love of our neighbor. And foraſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much as the Phariſes (with their moſt peſtilent Traditions, and falſe interpretations and gloſſes,) had corrupted, and almoſt clearly ſtopped up this pure Well of God's lively Word, Teaching, that this Love and Charity pertained only to a Man's Friends; and that it was ſufficient for a Man to love them which do love him, and hate his foes: Therefore Chriſt opened this Well again, purged it, and ſcoured it, by giving unto his Godly Law of Chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, a true and clear interpretation, which is this: That we ought to love every Man, both Friend and Foe, adding thereto, what commodity we ſhall have thereby, and what incommodity by doing the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary. What thing can we wiſh ſo good for us, as the Eternal Heavenly Father, to reckon and take us for his Children? And this we ſhall be ſure of, (ſaith Chriſt,) if we love every Man without exception. And if we do otherwiſe, (ſaith he,) we be no better than the Phariſees, Publicans and Heathen, and ſhall have our reward with them, that is, to be ſhut out from the number of God's choſen Children, and from his everlaſting Inheritance in Heaven.</p>
                     <p>Thus of true Charity, Chriſt taught, that every Man is bound to love God above all things, and to love every Man, Friend and Foe; and this likewiſe he did uſe himſelf, exhorting his Adverſaries, rebu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king the Faults of his Adverſaries, and when he could not amend them, yet he prayed for them. Firſt, he loved God his Father above all things, ſo much, that he ſought not his own Glory and Will, but the Glory and Will of his Father. <hi>I ſeek not</hi> (ſaid he,<note place="margin">John 6.</note>) <hi>mine own Will, but the Will of him that ſent me.</hi> Nor refuſed he to dye, to ſatisfie his Fathers Will, ſaying, <hi>If it may be, let this cup of death paſs from me:</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Matth. 26.</note> 
                        <hi>if not, thy Will be done,</hi> and not mine. He loved not only his Friends, but alſo his Enemies, which (in their Hearts,) bore exceeding great hatred againſt
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:54673:39"/> him, and with their Tongues ſpake all evil of him, and in their Acts and Deeds perſued him with all their Might and Power, even unto Death; yet all this notwithſtanding, he withdrew not his Favour from them, but ſtill loved them, preached unto them of Love, rebuked their falſe Doctrine, their wicked Living, and did good unto them, patiently taking whatſoever they ſpake, or did againſt him. When they gave him evil words, he gave none evil again. VVhen they did ſtrike him, he did not ſmite them again: And when he ſuffered death, he did not ſlay them, nor threaten them, but prayed for them, and did put all things to his Fathers Will. And as a Sheep that is led unto the Shambles to be ſlain, and as a Lamb that is ſhorn of his Fleece, maketh no noiſe nor reſiſtance, even ſo he went to his death, without any repugnance, or opening of his Mouth to ſay any evil. Thus have I ſet forth unto you what Charity is, as well by the Doctrine, as by the Example of Chriſt himſelf; whereby alſo every Man may without error know himſelf, what ſtate and condition he ſtandeth in, whether he be in Charity, (and ſo the Child of the Father in Heaven,) or not. For although almoſt every Man perſuadeth himſelf to be in Charity, yet let him examine none other Man, but his own Heart, his Life and Converſation, and he ſhall not be deceived, but truly diſcern and judge whether he be in perfect Charity or not. For he that followeth not his own Appetite and Will, but giveth himſelf earneſtly to God, to do all his Will and Commandments, he may be ſure that he loveth God above all things, and elſe ſurely he lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth him not, whatſoever he pretend: As Chriſt ſaid, <hi>If ye love me, keep my Commandments.</hi> For, <hi>he that knoweth my Commandments, and keepeth them, he it is,</hi> (ſaith Chriſt) <hi>that loveth me.</hi> And again he ſaith,<note place="margin">John 14.</note> 
                        <hi>He that loveth me will keep my words, and and my Father will love him, and we will both come to him, and dwell with him: And he that loveth me not, will not keep my words.</hi> And likewiſe he that
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:54673:39"/> beareth a good Heart and Mind, and uſeth well his Tongue and Deeds unto every man, Friend and Foe, he may know thereby that he hath Charity. And then he is ſure, that Almighty God taketh him for his dear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly beloved Son, as <hi>St. John</hi> ſaith, <hi>Hereby manifeſtly are known the children of God from the children of the Devil: For whoſoever doth not love his Brother,</hi>

                     <head>The Second Part of the Sermon of Charity.</head>
                     <p>YOu have heard a plain and fruitful ſetting forth of Charity, and how profitable and neceſſary a thing Charity is: How Charity ſtretcheth itſelf both to God and Man, Friend and Foe, and that by the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine and Example of Chriſt: And alſo who may certifie himſelf whether he be in perfect Charity, or not. Now as concerning the ſame matter, it follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth. The perverſe Nature of Man,<note place="margin">Againſt carnal Men, that will not forgive their Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies.</note> corrupt with Sin, and deſtitute of God's Word and Grace, thinketh it againſt all reaſon, that a Man ſhould love his Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, and hath many perſuaſions which bring him to the contrary. Againſt all which Reaſons, we ought aſwell to ſet the Teaching, as the Living of our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour Chriſt, who loving us (when we were his Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies,) doth teach us <hi>to love our Enemies.</hi> He did patiently take for us many reproaches, ſuffered Beat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and moſt cruel Death. Therefore we be no Members of him, if we will not follow him. <hi>Chriſt</hi> (ſaith <hi>St. Peter,) ſuffered for us, leaving an Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple that we ſhould follow him.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Furthermore, we muſt conſider,<note place="margin">1 Pet. 2.</note> that to love our Friends, is no more but that which Thieves, Adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terers, Homicides, and all wicked Perſons do: Inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much that Jews, Turks, Infidels, and all brute Beaſts, do love them that be their Friends, of whom they have their living, or any other benefits. But to love Enemies is the proper condition of them, that
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:54673:40"/> be the Children of God, the Diſciples and Followers of Chriſt. Notwithſtanding Man's froward and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt Nature weigheth over-deeply many times the offence and diſpleaſure done unto him by Enemies, and thinketh it a burden intolerable, to be bound to love them that hate him. But the burden ſhould be eaſie enough, if (on the other ſide,) every Man would conſider, what diſpleaſure he hath done to his Enemy again, and what pleaſure he hath received of his Enemy. And if we find no equal or even re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compence, neither in receiving pleaſures of our Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, nor in requiting diſpleaſures unto him again: Then let us ponder the diſpleaſures which we have done unto Almighty God, how often and how grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouſly we have offended him, whereof if we will have of God forgiveneſs, there is none other remedy, but to forgive the offences done unto us, which be very ſmall in compariſon of our offences done againſt God. And if we conſider, that he, which hath offend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed us, deſerveth not to be forgiven of us, let us con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider again, that we much leſs deſerve to be forgiven of God. And although our Enemy deſerve not to be forgiven for his own ſake, yet we ought to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give him for God's Love, conſidering how great and many benefits we have received of him without our deſerts, and that Chriſt hath deſerved of us, that for his ſake we ſhould forgive them their treſpaſſes committed againſt us. But here may riſe a neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry queſtion to be diſſolved.<note place="margin">A Queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</note> If Charity require to think, ſpeak, and do well unto every Man, both good and evil: How can Magiſtrates execute Juſtice upon Malefactors or Evil-doers with Charity, How can they caſt evil Men in priſon, take away their Goods, and ſomtimes their Lives, according to Laws; if Charity will not ſuffer them ſo to do?

<pb n="67" facs="tcp:54673:40"/> be executed. For Declaration whereof, you ſhall underſtand, that Charity hath two Offices,<note place="margin">Charity hath two Offices.</note> the one contrary to the other, and yet both neceſſary to be uſed upon Men of contrary ſort and diſpoſition. The one Office of Charity is, to cheriſh good and harm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs Men, not to oppreſs them with falſe Accuſations, but to encourage them with Rewards to do well, and to continue in well-doing, defending them with the Sword from their Adverſaries: As the Office of Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops and Paſtors is, to praiſe Good Men for well-doing, that they may continue therein, and to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buke and correct, by the Word of God, the Offences and Crimes of all evil-diſpoſed Perſons. The other Office of Charity is, to rebuke, correct, and puniſh Vice, without regard of Perſons, and is to be uſed againſt them only that be evil Men, and Malefactors or evil-doers. And that it is aſwel the Office of Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity to rebuke, puniſh, and correct them that be evil, as it is to cheriſh and reward them that be good and harmleſs, <hi>St. Paul</hi> declareth (writing to the <hi>Romans,</hi>) ſaying,<note place="margin">Rom. 13.</note> 
                        <hi>That the high powers are ordained of God, not to be dreadful to them that do well, but unto Malefactors, to draw the Sword to take ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance of him that committeth the Sin.</hi> And <hi>St. Paul</hi> biddeth <hi>Timothy ſtoutly and earneſtly to rebuke Sin by the Word of God.</hi>
                        <note place="margin">1 Tim. 13.</note> So that both Offices ſhould be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligently executed, to fight againſt the Kingdom of the Devil, the Preacher with the Word, and the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernours with the Sword. Elſe they neither love God, nor them whom they Govern, if (for lack of correction,) they wilfully ſuffer God to be offend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and them whom they Govern, to periſh. For as every loving Father correcteth his Natural Son when he doth amiſs, or elſe he loveth him not: So all Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernors of Realms, Countries, Towns, and Houſes, ſhould lovingly correct them which be Offenders under their Governance, and cheriſh them which live innocently, if they have any reſpect either unto God and their Office, or love unto them of whom they have Governance. And ſuch rebukes and puniſhments
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:54673:41"/> of them that offend, muſt be done in due time, leſt by delay the offenders fall headlong into all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of miſchief, and not only be evil themſelves, but alſo do hurt unto many Men, drawing others by their evil example, to ſin and outrage after them. As one Thief may both rob many Men, and alſo make many Thieves: And one ſeditious Perſon may allure many, and annoy a whole Town or Country. And ſuch evil perſons that be ſo great offenders to God and the Commonweal, Charity requireth to be cut from the Body of the Commonweal, leſt they cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt other good and honeſt Perſons: Like as a good Surgeon cutteth away a rotten and feſtered Member, for love he hath to the whole Body, leſt it infect other Members adjoyning unto it. Thus it is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared unto you, what true Charity, or Chriſtian Love is, ſo plainly, that no Man need to be decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved. Which Love whoſoever keepeth, not only towards God, (whom he is bound to love above all things,) but alſo toward his Neighbor, as well Friend as Foe, it ſhall ſurely keep him from all of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of God, and juſt offence of Man. Therefore bear well away this one ſhort leſſon, That by true Chriſtian Charity, God ought to be loved, Good and Evil, Friend and Foe, and to all ſuch we ought (as we may,) to do good: Thoſe that be good, of Love to encourage and cheriſh, becauſe they be good: And thoſe that be evil, of Love, to procure and ſeek their correction, and due puniſhment, that they may thereby either be brought to Goodneſs, or at the leaſt, that God and the Commonwealth may be leſs hurt and offended. And if we thus direct our Life, by Chriſtian Love and Charity, then Chriſt doth promiſe and aſſure us that he loveth us, that we be the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of our Heavenly Father, reconciled to his Favour, very Members of Chriſt, and that after this ſhort time of this preſent and mortal Life, we ſhall have with him everlaſting Life in his everlaſting Kingdom of Heaven. Therefore to Him, with the Father, and the Holy Ghoſt, be all Honour and Glory, now and for ever, Amen.</p>

                  <div n="1" type="part">
                     <p>ALmighty God, to the intent his moſt Holy Name ſhould be had in Honour, and ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more be Magnified of the People, commandeth rhat no Man ſhould take his Name vainly in his Mouth, threatning puniſhment unto him that unreverently abuſeth it by Swearing, Forſwearing, and Blaſphemy. To the intent therefore,<note place="margin">How and in what cauſes it is lawful to Swear.</note> that this Commandment may be the better known and kept, it ſhall be decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red unto you, both how it is lawful for Chriſtian People to Swear, and alſo what peril and danger it is, vainly to Swear, or to be Forſworn. Firſt, when Judges require Oaths of the People for declaration, or opening of the Truth, or for execution of Juſtice, this manner of Swearing is lawful. Alſo when Men make faithful Promiſes, with calling to witneſs of the Name of God, to keep Covenants, honeſt Promiſes, Statutes, Laws, and good Cuſtoms, as Chriſtian Princes do in their concluſion of Peace, for con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation of Commonwealths; and private Perſons promiſe their Fidelity in Matrimony, or one to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in Honeſty and true Friendſhip: And all Men when they do Swear to keep common Laws, and local Statuts, and good Cuſtoms, for due order to be had and continued among Men; when Subjects do Swear to be true and faithful to their King and Sovereign Lord, and when Judges, Magiſtrates, and Officers Swear truly to execute their Offices; and
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:54673:42"/> when a Man would affirm the Truth to the ſetting forth God's Glory, (for the Salvation of the People,) in open preaching of the Goſpel, or in giving of good Counſel privately for their Souls health: All theſe manners of Swearing, for Cauſes neceſſary and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt, be lawful. But when Men do Swear of cuſtom, in reaſoning, buying and ſelling, or other daily communications, (as many be common and great Swearers,) ſuch kind of Swearing is ungodly, unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, and forbidden by the Commandment of God. For ſuch Swearing is nothing elſe, but taking of God's Holy Name in vain. And here is to be noted, that lawful Swearing is not forbidden, but com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded by Almighty God. For we have examples of Chriſt and Godly Men, in Holy Scripture, that did Swear themſelves, and required Oaths of others likewiſe,<note place="margin">Deut. 6.</note> and God's Commandment is, <hi>Thou ſhalt dread thy Lord God, and ſhalt ſwear by his Name.</hi> And Almighty God by his Prophet <hi>David</hi> ſaith,<note place="margin">Pſal. 63.</note> 
                        <hi>All Men ſhall be praiſed that ſwear by him.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Thus did our Saviour Chriſt Swear divers times, ſaying <hi>Verily,</hi>

                     </p>
                     <p>Alſo God once commanded, that if a thing were laid to pledge to any Man, or left with him to keep, if the ſame thing were ſtoln, or loſt, that the keeper thereof ſhould be Sworn before Judges, that he did not conveigh it away, nor uſed any deceit in cauſing the ſame to be conveighed away, by his conſent or knowledge.<note place="margin">Heb. 6.</note> And <hi>St. Paul</hi> ſaith, That

And moreover, God by the Prophet <hi>Jere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my</hi> ſaith, <hi>Thou ſhalt ſwear, the Lord liveth in truth,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Jer. 4.</note> 
                        <hi>in judgment, in righteouſneſs.</hi> So that whoſoever Sweareth, when he is required of a Judge, let him be ſure in his Conſcience, that his Oath have three Conditions, and he ſhall never need to be afraid of Perjury.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, he that Sweareth may Swear truly, that is,<note place="margin">What con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions an Oath ought to have.</note> he muſt (ſetting apart all Favour and Affection to the Parties,) have the Truth only before his Eyes, and for love thereof, ſay and ſpeak that which he knoweth to be Truth, and no further.<note place="margin">The Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond.</note> The Second is, he that taketh an Oath, muſt do it with judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, not raſhly and unadviſedly, but ſoberly, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering what an Oath is. The Third is,<note place="margin">The Third.</note> He that Sweareth, muſt Swear in Righteouſneſs. That is, for the very Zeal and Love which he beareth to the defence of Innocency, to the maintenance of the Truth, and of the Righteouſneſs of the Matter or Cauſe; all Profit, Diſprofit, all Love and Favour un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Perſon for Friendſhip or Kindred laid apart. Thus an Oath (if it have with it theſe three Conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,) is a part of God's Glory,<note place="margin">Why we be willed in Scripture to Swear by the Name of God.</note> which we are bound by his Commandments to give unto him. For he willeth that we ſhall Swear only by his Name, not that he hath pleaſure in Oaths; but like as he command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Jews to offer Sacrifice unto him, not for any delight that he had in them, but to keep the Jews from committing Idolatry: So he Commanding us to Swear by his Holy Name,<note place="margin">Iſai. 42.</note> doth not teach its that he delighteth in Swearing, but he thereby forbiddeth all Men to give his Glory to any Creature in Heaven, Earth, or Water. Hitherto you ſee, that Oaths law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful are Commanded of God, uſed of Patriarchs and Prophets, of Chriſt himſelf, and of his Apoſtle <hi>Pau<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="72" facs="tcp:54673:43"/> both Godly and neceſſary.<note place="margin">Commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities had by lawful Oaths made and obſerved.</note> For by lawful Promiſe and Covenants confirmed by Oaths, Princes and their Countries are confirmed in common Tranquillity and Peace. By Holy Promiſes with calling the name of God to witneſs, we be made lively Members of Chriſt, when we profeſs his Religion receiving the Sacrament of Baptiſm. By like Holy Promiſe the Sacrament of Matrimony knitteth Man and Wife in perpetual Love, that they deſire not to be ſeparated for any diſpleaſure or adverſity that ſhall after happen. By lawful Oaths, which Kings, Princes, Judges, and Magiſtrates do Swear, Common Laws are kept invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olate, Juſtice is indifferently miniſtred, harmleſs Perſons, Fatherleſs Children, Widows, and poor Men are defended from Murderers, Oppreſſors, and Thieves, that they ſuffer no wrong, nor take any harm. By lawful Oaths, mutual Society, Amity, and good Order is kept continually in all Communal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, as Boroughs, Cities, Towns, and Villages. And by lawful Oaths, Malefactors are ſearched out, Wrong doers are puniſhed, and they which ſuſtain wrong are reſtored to their right. Therefore lawful Swear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing cannot be evil, which bringeth unto us ſo many Godly,<note place="margin">Vain Swearing is forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den.</note> Good, and neceſſary Commodities, Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore when Chriſt ſo earneſtly forbade Swearing, it may not be underſtood, as though he did forbid all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of Oaths: But he forbiddeth all vain-Swearing, and forſwearing, both by God, and by his Creatures, as the common uſe of Swearing in Buying, Selling, and in our daily Communication, to the intent eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Chriſtian Man's Word ſhould be as well regarded in ſuch matters. as if he ſhould confirm his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication with an Oath. For every Chriſtian Man's Word (ſaith <hi>St. Hierom,</hi>) ſhould be ſo true, that it ſhould be regarded as an Oath. And <hi>Chryſoſtome</hi> witneſſing the ſame, ſaith, It is not convenient to Swear: For what need we to Swear, when it is not lawful for one of us to make a lye unto another? Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>adventure ſome will ſay,<note place="margin">An Object.</note> I am compelled to Swear, or elſe Men that do commune with me, or do buy and

                     <head>The Second Part of the Sermon of Swearing.</head>
                     <p>YOu have been taught in the Firſt Part of this Sermon againſt Swearing and Perjury, what great danger it is to uſe the Name of God in vain. And that all kind of Swearing is not unlawful, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther againſt God's Commandment; and that there be three things required in a lawful Oath. Firſt, that it be made for the maintainance of the Truth. Secondly, that it be made with Judgment, not raſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and unadviſedly. Thirdly, for the zeal and love of Juſtice. Ye heard alſo, what commodities come of lawful Oaths, and what danger cometh of raſh and unlawful Oaths. Now as concerning the reſt of the ſame matter, you ſhall underſtand, that as well they uſe the Name of God in vain, that by an Oath make unlawful promiſes of good and honeſt things, and perform them not: As they which do promiſe evil and unlawful things, and do perform the ſame. Of ſuch Men,<note place="margin">Lawful Oaths and Promiſes would be better re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded.

Firſt, <hi>Joſhua</hi> and the people of <hi>Iſrael</hi> made a League and faithful Promiſe of perpetual Amity and Friendſhip with the Gibeonites: Not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding afterwards in the days of wicked <hi>Saul,</hi> many of theſe Gibeonites were murthered, contrary to the ſaid faithful Promiſe made. Wherewith Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty God was ſore diſpleaſed, that he ſent an uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal Hunger upon the whole Country, which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued by the ſpace of three years.

And of them that make wicked Promiſes by an Oath, and will perform the ſame, we have example in the Scriptures, chiefly of <hi>Herod,</hi> of the wicked Jews, and of <hi>Jeptha.</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Matth. 14.</note> 
                        <hi>Herod</hi> promiſed by an Oath unto the Damſel which danced before him, to give unto her whatſoever ſhe ſhould ask: When ſhe was inſtructed before of her wicked Mother, to ask the Head of <hi>St. John Baptiſt.

                        <hi>curſing themſelves if they did either eat or drink, until they had ſlain St. Paul.</hi> And <hi>Jeptha,</hi> when God had given to him victory of the Children of <hi>Ammon,</hi> promiſed (of a fooliſh Devotion) unto God, to offer for a Sacrifice unto him, that Perſon which of his own Houſe ſhould firſt meet with him, after his return home. By force of which fond and unadviſed Oath, he did ſlay his own and only Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, which came out of his Houſe with Mirth and Joy to welcome him home. Thus the Promiſe which he made (moſt fooliſhly) to God, againſt God's everlaſting Will, and the Law of Nature, moſt cruelly he performed, ſo committing againſt God a double offence. Therefore, whoſoever maketh any Promiſe, binding himſelf thereunto by an Oath, let him foreſee, that the thing which he promiſeth be good and honeſt, and not againſt the Commandment of God; and that it be in his own power to perform it juſtly. And ſuch good Promiſes muſt all Men keep evermore aſſuredly. But if a Man at any time
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:54673:45"/> ſhall, either of Ignorance, or of Malice, Promiſe and Swear to do any thing which is either againſt the Law of Almighty God, or not in his power to perform: Let him take it for an unlawful and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly Oath.</p>
                     <p>Now ſomthing to ſpeak of Perjury, to the intent you ſhould know how great and grievous an offence againſt God this wilful Perjury is; I will ſhew you what it is to take an Oath before a Judge upon a Book.<note place="margin">Againſt Perjury.</note> Firſt, when they laying their hands upon the Goſpel Book, do Swear truly no enquire, and to make a true preſentment of things wherewith they be charged,<note place="margin">An Oath before a Judge.</note> and not to let from ſaying the Truth, and doing tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for favour, love, dread or malice of any Perſon, as God may help them and the Holy Contents of that Book: They muſt conſider, that in that Book is contained God's everlaſting Truth, his moſt Holy and Eternal Word, whereby we have forgiveneſs of our Sins, and be made inheritors of Heaven, to live for ever with God's Angels and Saints, in Joy and Gladneſs. In the Goſpel Book is contained alſo God's terrible threats to obſtinate ſinners, that will not amend their lives, nor believe the Truth of God's Holy Word, and the everlaſting pain prepared in Hell for Idolaters, Hypocrites, for falſe and vain Swearers, for perjured Men, for Falſe Witneſs-bear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, for Falſe Condemners of innocent and guiltleſs Men, and for them which for favour hide the crimes of evil doers, that they ſhould not be puniſhed. So that whoſoever wilfully forſwear themſelves upon Chriſt's Holy Evangely, they utterly forſake God's Mercy, Goodneſs, and Truth, the Merits of our Saviour Chriſt's Nativity, Life, Paſſion, Death, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection, and Aſcenſion, they refuſe the forgive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Sins promiſed to all penitent Sinners, the joyes of Heaven, the company with Angels and Saints for ever.

Wherefore the Lord ſhewed his great Indignation upon them. <hi>It came to paſs,</hi> (ſaith the Prophet,) <hi>even as I told them: As they would not hear, ſo when they cried, they were not heard, but were ſcattered into all Kingdoms which they ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver knew, and their land was made deſolate.</hi>

And on the other part he ſaith, Whoſoever is occupied with Fables and Tales, when the Word of God is rehearſed, he is turned from God. Whoſoever in time of reading God's Word, is careful in his mind of Worldly buſineſs, of Money, or of Lucre, he is turned from God. Whoſoever is intangled with the cares of Poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſions, filled with covetouſneſs of Riches; Who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever ſtudieth for the Glory and Honour of this World, he is turned from God. So that after his Mind, whoſoever hath not a ſpecial mind to that thing that is commanded or taught of God; he that doth not liſten unto it, embrace, and imprint it in his Heart, to the intent that he may duly faſhion his life thereafter, he is plainly turned from God, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though he do other things of his own Devotion and Mind, which to him ſeem better, and more to God's Honour. Which thing to be true, we be taught and admoniſhed in the Holy Scripture, by the example of King <hi>Saul,</hi> who being commanded of God by <hi>Samuel,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">1 Kings 15.</note> that he ſhould kill all the Amalekites, and deſtroy them clearly with their Goods and Cattle: Yet he, being moved partly with pity, and partly (as he thought,) with devotion unto God, ſaved <hi>Agag</hi> the King, and all the chief of their Cattel, therewith to make Sacrifice unto God.

                     <p>But <hi>Samuel,</hi> reproving all ſuch intents and devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions (ſeem they never ſo much to God's Honour, if they ſtand not with his Word, whereby we may be aſſured of his pleaſure,) ſaid on this wiſe, Would God have Sacrifices and Offerings: Or rather, that his Word ſhould be obeyed? <hi>To obey him is better than offerings, and to liſten to him is better than to offer the fat of Rams: yea, to repugn againſt his voice is as evil as the ſin of ſoothſaying; and not to agree to it is like abominable Idolatry. And now foraſmuch as thou haſt caſt away the word of the Lord, he hath caſt away thee, that thou ſhouldeſt not be King.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>By all theſe examples of Holy Scripture,<note place="margin">The turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of God from Man.</note> we may know, that as we forſake God, ſo ſhall he ever for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake us. And what miſerable ſtate doth conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and neceſſarily follow thereupon, a Man may eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly conſider by the terrible threatnings of God. And although he conſider not all the ſaid miſery to the uttermoſt, being ſo great that it paſſeth any Man's capacity in this life ſufficiently to conſider the ſame: Yet he ſhall ſoon perceive ſo much thereof, that if his Heart be not more than ſtony, or harder than the Adamant, he ſhall fear, tremble, and quake, to call the ſame to his remembrance. Firſt, the diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of God towards us is commonly expreſſed in the Scripture by theſe two things: By ſhewing his fearful Countenance upon us, and by turning his Face, or hiding it from us. By ſhewing his dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Countenance, is ſignified his great wrath: But by turning his Face, or hiding thereof, is many times more ſignified, that is to ſay, That he clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly forſaketh us, and giveth us over. The which ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifications be taken of the properties of Mens man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners. For Men, towards them whom they favour, commonly bear a good, a chearful, and a loving Countenance: So that by the Face or Countenance of a Man, it doth commonly appear, what Will or Mind he beareth towards others. So when God doth ſhew his dreadful Countenance towards us, that is to ſay, doth ſend dreadful plagues of Sword, Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine,
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:54673:48"/> or Peſtilence upon us; it appeareth that he is greatly wroth with us. But when he withdraweth from us his Word, the right Doctrine of Chriſt, his Gracious aſſiſtance and aid, (which is ever joyned to his Word,) and leaveth us to our own Wit, our own Will and Strength: He declareth then, that he beginneth to forſake us. For whereas God hath ſhewed to all them that truly believe his Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, his Face of Mercy in Jeſus Chriſt, which doth ſo lighten their Hearts, that they (if they behold it as they ought to do,) be transformed to his Image, be made partakers of the Heavenly Light, and of his Holy Spirit, and be faſhioned to him in all Goodneſs requiſite to the Children of God: So, if they after do neglect the ſame; if they be unthankful unto him, if they order not their lives according to his Example and Doctrine, and to the ſetting forth of his Glory, he will take away from them his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, his Holy Word, whereby he ſhould reign in them, becauſe they bring not forth the fruit there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of that he looketh for. Nevertheleſs, he is ſo mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciful, and of ſo long-ſufferance, that he doth not ſhew upon us that great wrath ſuddainly. But when we begin to ſhrink from his Word, not believing it, or not expreſſing it in our livings: Firſt, he doth ſend his Meſſengers, the true Preachers of his Word, to admoniſh and warn us of our Duty: That as he for his part, for the great love he bare unto us, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered his own Son to ſuffer death, that we by his death might be delivered from death, and be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtored to the Life everlaſting; evermore to dwell with him, and to be partakers and inheritors with him of his everlaſting Glory and Kingdom of Heaven: So again, that we for our parts ſhould walk in a Godly life, as becometh his Children to do. And if this will not ſerve, but ſtill we remain diſobedient to his Word and Will, not knowing him, nor loving him, nor fearing him, nor putting our whole truſt and confidence in him: And on the other ſide, to Neighbours behaving our ſelves uncharitably, by
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:54673:48"/> Diſdain, Envy, Malice, or by committing Murder, Robbery, Adultery, Gluttony, Deceit, Lying, Swea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, or other like deteſtable Works,<note place="margin">Heb. 3.</note> and ungodly behaviour, then he threatneth us by terrible Commi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations, ſwearing in great Anger,<note place="margin">Pſal. 15.</note> that <hi>whoſoever doth theſe Works, ſhall never enter into his Reſt,</hi>

                     <p>IN the former part of this Sermon, ye have learned how many manner of ways Men fall from God: Some by Idolatry, ſome for lack of Faith, ſome by neglecting of their Neighbours, ſome by not hearing of God's Word, ſome by the Pleaſure they take in the Vanities of worldly things. Ye have alſo lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, in what miſery that Man is, which is gone from God: And how that God, yet, of his infinite Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, to call again Man from that his miſery, uſeth firſt gentle Admonitions by his Preachers, after, he layeth on terrible Threatnings. Now, if this gentle Monition and Threatning together do not ſerve, then God will ſhew his terrible Countenance upon us, he will pour intolerable Plagues upon our Heads, and after, he will take away from us all his Aid and Aſſiſtance, wherewith before, he did defend us from all ſuch manner of Calamity. As the Evangelical Prophet <hi>Iſaiah,</hi> agreeing with Chriſt's Parable,<note place="margin">Iſaiah 5.</note> doth teach us, ſaying, <hi>That God had made a goodly Vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yard for his beloved Children, he hedged it, he walled it round about, he planted it with choſen Vines, and made a Turret in the mid'ſt thereof,</hi>

                        </note> 
                        <hi>and therein alſo a Vine-preſs. And when he looked that it ſhould bring forth good Grapes, it brought forth wild Grapes:</hi> And after it followeth, <hi>Now ſhall I ſhew you,</hi> (ſaith God,) <hi>what I will do with my Vineyard: I will pluck down the Hedges, that it may periſh: I will break down the Walls, that it may be troden under foot: I will
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:54673:49"/> let it lye waſte, it ſhall not be cut, it ſhall not be dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, but Bryers and Thorns ſhall overgrow it, and I ſhall command the Clouds, that they ſhall no more rain upon it.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>By theſe Threatnings we are moniſhed and war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, that if we, which are the choſen Vineyard of God, bring not forth good Grapes, that is to ſay, good Works that may be delectable and pleaſant in his ſight, when he looketh for them, when he ſend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth his Meſſengers to call upon us for them, but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther bring forth wild Grapes, that is to ſay, ſower Works, unſavoury, and unfruitful: Then will he pluck away all defence, and ſuffer grievous plagues of Famine, Battel, Dearth, and Death, to light up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on us. Finally, if theſe ſerve not, he will let us lie waſte, he will give us over, he will turn away from us, he will dig and delve no more about us, he will let us alone, and ſuffer us to bring forth even ſuch Fruit as we will, to bring forth Brambles, Bryers, and Thorns, all Naughtineſs, all Vice, and that ſo abundantly, that they ſhall clean overgrow us, choke, ſtrangle, and utterly deſtroy us. But they, that in this World live not after God, but after their own Carnal liberty, perceive not this great Wrath of God towards them, that he will not dig, nor delve any more about them, that he doth let them alone even to themſelves. But they take this for a great benefit of God, to have all their own Liberty: And ſo they live, as if Carnal liberty were the true Liberty of the Goſpel. But God forbid, (good People,) that ever we ſhould deſire ſuch Liberty. For although God ſuffer ſomtimes the wicked to have their Pleaſure in this World, yet the end of ungodly Living is, at length, endleſs deſtruction. The murmuring <hi>Iſra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elites</hi> had that they longed for,<note place="margin">Numb. 11.</note> they had Quails enough, yea, till they were weary of them. But what was the end thereof? Their ſweet Meat had ſow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er Sauce: Even while the Meat was in their Mouths, the plague of God lighted upon them, and ſuddenly they died. So, if we live ungodlily, and God ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:54673:49"/> us to follow our own Wills, to have our own De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights and Pleaſures, and correcteth us not with ſome plague, it is no doubt but he is almoſt utterly diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed with us. And although it be long ere he ſtrike, yet many times when he ſtriketh ſuch Perſons, he ſtriketh them at once for ever. So that when he doth not ſtrike us, when he ceaſeth to afflict us, to puniſh or beat us, and ſuffereth us to run headlong into all Ungodlineſs, and Pleaſures of this World that we delight in, without Puniſhment and Adverſity, it is a dreadful token, that he loveth us no longer, that he careth no longer for us, but hath given us over to our ownſelves. As long as a Man doth prune his Vines, doth dig at the Roots, and doth lay freſh Earth to them, he hath a Mind to them, he percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth ſome token of Fruitfulneſs, that may be reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered in them; but when he will beſtow no more ſuch Coſt and Labour about them, then it is a ſign, that he thinketh they will never be good. And the Father, as long as he loveth his Child, he looketh angerly, he correcteth him when he doth amiſs: But when that ſerveth not, and upon that he ceaſeth from correction of him, and ſuffereth him to do what he liſt himſelf, it is a ſign that he intendeth to diſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herit him, and to caſt him away for ever. So ſurely nothing ſhould pierce our heart ſo ſore, and put us in ſuch horrible fear, as when we know in our Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, that we have grievouſly offended God, and do ſo continue, and that yet he ſtriketh not, but quietly ſuffereth us in the Naughtineſs that we have delight in. Then ſpecially it is time to cry, and to cry again, as <hi>David</hi> did,<note place="margin">Pſal. 51.</note> 
                        <hi>Caſt me not away from thy Face, and take not away thy Holy Spirit from me. Lord, turn not away thy Face from me, caſt not thy Servant away in Diſpleaſure. Hide not thy Face from me, leſt I be like unto them that go down to Hell.</hi> The which lamentable Prayers of him, as they do certifie us, what horrible danger they be in, from whom God turneth his Face, (for the time, and as long as he ſo doth:) So ſhould they move and ſtir
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:54673:50"/> us to cry upon God with all our heart, that we may not be brought into that State, which doubtleſs is ſo ſorrowful, ſo miſerable, and ſo dreadful, as no Tongue can ſufficiently expreſs, nor any Heart can think. For what deadly grief may a man ſuppoſe it is, to be under the Wrath of God, to be forſaken of him, to have his Holy Spirit, the Author of all Goodneſs, to be taken from him, to be brought to ſo vile a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, that he ſhall be left meet for no better pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, than to be for ever condemned in Hell? For not only ſuch places of <hi>David</hi> do ſhew, that upon the turning of God's Face from any Perſons, they ſhall be left bare from all Goodneſs, and far from hope of remedy: But alſo the place, rehearſed laſt before, of <hi>Iſaiah,</hi> doth mean the ſame, which ſheweth, that God at length doth ſo forſake his unfruitful Vineyard, that he will not only ſuffer it to bring forth Weeds, Bryers, and Thorns, but alſo further to puniſh the unfruitfulneſs of it; he ſaith, he will not cut it, he will not delve it, and he will command the Clouds, that they ſhall not rain upon it: Whereby is ſignifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the teaching of his Holy Word, which <hi>St. Paul,</hi> after a like manner, expreſſed by Planting and Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering, meaning, that he will take that away from them, ſo that they ſhall be no longer of his Kingdom, they ſhall be no longer governed by his Holy Spirit, they ſhall be put from the Grace and Benefits that they had, and ever might have enjoyed, through Chriſt, they ſhall be deprived of the Heavenly Light and Life which they had in Chriſt, whil'ſt they abode in him: They ſhall be (as they were once,) as Men without God in this World, or rather, in worſe ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king. And to be ſhort, they ſhall be given into the Power of the Devil, which beareth the Rule in all them that be caſt away from God,<note place="margin">1 Kings 15.</note> as he did in <hi>Saul</hi> and <hi>Judas,</hi> and generally in all ſuch, as work after their own Wills, the Children of miſtruſt and unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief. Let us beware therefore, (good Chriſtian Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,) leſt that we, rejecting or caſting away God's Word, (by the which we obtain and retain true Faith
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:54673:50"/> in God,) be not at length caſt off ſo far, that we become as the Children of unbelief; which be of two ſorts, far diverſe, yea, almoſt clean contrary, and yet both be very far from returning to God; the one ſort, only weighing their ſinful and deteſtable Living, with the right Judgment and Straitneſs of God's Righteouſneſs, be ſo without Counſel, and be ſo comfortleſs, (as they all muſt needs be, from whom the Spirit of Counſel and Comfort is gone,) that they will not be perſuaded in their Hearts, but that either God cannot, or elſe that he will not take them again to his Favour and Mercy. The other, hearing the loving and large Promiſes of God's Mercy, and ſo not conceiving a right Faith thereof, make thoſe Promiſes larger than ever God did, truſting, that although they continue in their ſinful and deteſtable Living never ſo long, yet that God, at the end of their Life, will ſhew his Mercy upon them, and that then they will return. And both theſe two ſorts of Men be in a damnable ſtate; and yet nevertheleſs, God <hi>(who willeth not the Death of the wicked,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Ezek. 18. and 33.</note>) hath ſhewed means, whereby, both the ſame (if they take heed in ſeaſon,) may eſcape. The firſt,<note place="margin">Againſt deſpera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> as they do dread God's rightful Juſtice in puniſhing Sinners, (where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by they ſhould be diſmayed, and ſhould deſpair in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, as touching any hope that may be in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,) ſo, if they would conſtantly or ſtedfaſtly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, that God's Mercy is the Remedy appointed againſt ſuch deſpair and diſtruſt, not only for them, but generally for all that be ſorry and truely repentant, and will therewithal ſtick to God's Mercy, they may be ſure they ſhall obtain Mercy, and enter into the Port or Haven of Safeguard, into the which whoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever doth come, be they beforetime never ſo wicked, they ſhall be out of danger of everlaſting damnation,<note place="margin">Ezek. 3.</note> as God, by <hi>Ezekiel,</hi> ſaith, <hi>What time ſoever a Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner doth return, and take earneſt and true Repentance,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Againſt Preſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> 
                        <hi>I will forget all his Wickedneſs.</hi> The other, as they be ready to believe God's Promiſes, ſo they ſhould be as ready to believe the Threatnings of
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:54673:51"/> God: As well they ſhould believe the Law, as the Goſpel: As well that there is an Hell and everlaſting Fire, as that there is an Heaven, and everlaſting Joy: As well they ſhould believe Damnation to be threatned to the wicked and evil doers, as Salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to be promiſed to the faithful in Word and Works: As well they ſhould believe God to be true in the one, as in the other. And the Sinners, that conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue in their wicked living, ought to think, that the Promiſes of God's Mercy, and the Goſpel, pertain not unto them being in that ſtate, but only the Law, and thoſe Scriptures which contain the Wrath and Indignation of God, and his Threatnings, which ſhould certifie them, that as they do over-boldly preſume of God's Mercy, and live diſſolutely: So doth God ſtill more and more withdraw his Mercy from them, and he is ſo provoked thereby to wrath at length, that he deſtroyeth ſuch Preſumers many times ſuddenly.<note place="margin">1 Theſſ. 5.</note> For of ſuch <hi>St. Paul</hi> ſaith thus, <hi>When they ſhall ſay, it is Peace, there is no danger, then ſhall ſudden deſtruction come upon them.</hi> Let us beware therefore of ſuch naughty bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to Sin. For God, which hath promiſed his Mercy to them that be truly repentant, (although it be at the later end,) hath not promiſed to the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumptuous Sinner, either that he ſhall have long Life, or that he ſhall have true Repentance at the laſt end. But for that purpoſe hath he made every Man's death uncertain, that he ſhould not put his hope in the end, and in the mean ſeaſon (to God's high diſpleaſure,) live ungodly. Wherefore, let us follow the Counſel of the wiſe Man, let us make no tarrying to turn unto the Lord: Let us not put off from day to day, for ſuddenly ſhall his Wrath come, and in time of Vengeance he will deſtroy the wicked. Let us therefore turn betimes, and when we turn, let us pray to God,<note place="margin">Oſee 14.</note> as <hi>Oſee</hi> teacheth, ſaying, <hi>Forgive all our Sins, receive us graciouſly.</hi> And if we turn to him, with an humble and a very penitent Heart, he will receive us to his Favour and Grace for his Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:54673:51"/> Names ſake, for his Promiſe ſake, for his Truth and Mercies ſake, promiſed to all faithful Believers in Jeſus Chriſt, his only natural Son: To whom, the only Saviour of the World, with the Father and the Holy Ghoſt, be all honor, glory, and power, world without end.

                     <p>IT is not to be marvelled, that worldly Men do fear to die. For death depriveth them of all worldly Honors, Riches, and Poſſeſſions, in the fru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ition whereof, the worldly Man counteth himſelf happy, ſo long as he may enjoy them at his own Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, and otherwiſe, if he be diſpoſſeſſed of the ſame, without hope of recovery, then he can no otherwiſe think of himſelf, but that he is unhappy, becauſe he hath loſt his worldly Joy and Pleaſure. Alas, think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth this carnal Man, ſhall I now depart for ever from all my Honors, all my Treaſure, from my Country, Friends, Riches, Poſſeſſions, and worldly Pleaſures, which are my Joy and Heart's delight? Alas, that ever that day ſhould come, when all theſe I muſt bid farewel at once, and never enjoy any of them after. Wherefore it is not without great cauſe ſpoken of the wiſe Man, O Death,<note place="margin">Eccleſ. 41.</note> how bitter and ſower is the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance of thee to a Man, that liveth in Peace and Proſperity in his Subſtance, to a Man living at eaſe, leading his Life after his own Mind without trouble, and is therewithal well pampered and fed? There be other Men, whom this World doth not ſo greatly laugh upon, but rather vex and oppreſs with
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:54673:52"/> Poverty, Sickneſs, or ſome other Adverſity, yet they do fear death, partly, becauſe the Fleſh abhorreth naturally it's own ſorrowful diſſolution, which death doth threaten to them; and partly, by reaſon of Sickneſſes and painful diſeaſes, which be moſt ſtrong Pangs and Agonies in the Fleſh, and uſe commonly to come to ſick Men before death, or, at the leaſt, accompany death, whenſoever it cometh.</p>
                     <p>Although theſe two Cauſes ſeem great and weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to a worldly Man, whereupon he is moved to fear death, yet there is another Cauſe much greater than any of theſe afore rehearſed, for which; indeed he hath juſt cauſe to fear death, and that is the ſtate and condition whereunto at the laſt end death bringeth all them, that have their Hearts fixed upon this World, without Repentance and Amendment. This ſtate and condition is called the ſecond death, which unto all ſuch ſhall enſue after this bodily death. And this is that death which indeed ought to be dreaded and feared: For it is an everlaſting loſs, without remedy of the Grace and Favor of God, and of everlaſting Joy, Pleaſure, and Felicity. And it is not only the loſs for ever of all theſe eternal Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures, but alſo it is the condemnation both of Body and Soul, (without either appellation, or hope of redemption,) unto everlaſting pains in Hell. Unto this ſtate death ſent the unmerciful and ungodly rich Man,<note place="margin">Luke 16.</note> (that <hi>Luke</hi> ſpeaketh of in his Goſpel,) who living in all Wealth and Pleaſure in this World, and cheriſhing himſelf daily with dainty Fare, and gorge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Apparel, deſpiſed poor <hi>Lazarus</hi> that lay pitiful at his Gate, miſerably plagued and full of Sores, and alſo grievouſly pined with Hunger. Both theſe two were arreſted by death, which ſent <hi>Lazarus</hi> the poor miſerable Man, by Angels anon unto <hi>Abraham</hi>'s Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom, a place of Reſt, Pleaſure, and Conſolation: But the unmerciful rich Man deſcended down into Hell, and being in Torments, he cried for Comfort, complaining of the intolerable pain that he ſuffered in that flame of Fire, but it was too late. So unto
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:54673:52"/> this place bodily death ſendeth all them that in this World have their Joy and Felicity, all them that in this World be unfaithful unto God, and uncharita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble unto their Neighbours, ſo dying without Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance and hope of God's Mercy. Wherefore it is no marvel, that the worldly Man feareth death, for he hath much more cauſe ſo to do, than he himſelf doth conſider. Thus we ſee three Cauſes why worldly Men fear death. One,<note place="margin">The Firſt.</note> becauſe they ſhall loſe thereby their worldly Honors, Riches, Poſſeſſions, and all their Hearts deſires: Another,<note place="margin">Second.</note> becauſe of the pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful diſeaſes, and bitter pangs, which commonly Men ſuffer, either before, or at the time of death:<note place="margin">Third.</note> But the chief cauſe above all other, is the dread of the miſerable ſtate of eternal damnation both of Body and Soul, which they fear ſhall follow, after their departing from the worldly Pleaſures of this preſent Life.</p>
                     <p>For theſe Cauſes, be all mortal Men (which be gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to the love of this World,) both in fear, and ſtate of death, through Sin, (as the Holy Apoſtle ſaith,) ſo long as they live here in this World: But,<note place="margin">Heb. 10.</note> (everlaſting thanks be to Almighty God for ever,) there is never a one of all theſe Cauſes, no, nor yet them all together, that can make a true Chriſtian man afraid to die, (who is the very Member of Chriſt,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 3.</note> the Temple of the Holy Ghoſt, the Son of God, and the very Inheritor of the everlaſting Kingdom of Heaven;) but plainly contrary, he conceiveth great and many Cauſes, undoubtedly grounded upon the infallible and everlaſting truth of the Word of God, which moveth him not only to put away the fear of bodily death, but alſo for the manifold Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits and ſingular Commodities, which enſue unto every faithful Perſon by reaſon of the ſame, to wiſh, deſire, and long heartily for it. For death ſhall be to him no death at all, but a very deliverance from death, from all Pains, Cares, and Sorrows, Miſeries, and Wretchedneſs of this World, and the very en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try into Reſt, and a beginning of everlaſting Joy, a
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:54673:53"/> taſting of heavenly Pleaſures, ſo great, that neither Tongue is able to expreſs, neither Eye to ſee, nor Ear to hear them; no, nor any earthly Man's heart to conceive them. So exceeding great Benefits they be, which God our heavenly Father by his mere Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, and for the Love of his Son Jeſus Chriſt, hath laid up in ſtore, and prepared for them that humbly ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit themſelves to God's Will, and evermore unfeig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nedly love him from the bottom of their Hearts. And we ought to believe, that death, being ſlain by Chriſt, cannot keep any Man that ſtedfaſtly truſteth in Chriſt, under his perpetual Tyranny and Subjecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: But that he ſhall riſe from death again unto Glory at the laſt day, appointed by Almighty God, like as Chriſt our Head did riſe again, according to God's appointment, the third day. For <hi>St. Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtine</hi> ſaith, The Head going before, the Members truſt to follow and come after. And <hi>St. Paul</hi> ſaith, If Chriſt be riſen from the dead, we ſhall riſe alſo from the ſame. And to comfort all Chriſtian Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons herein, Holy Scripture calleth this bodily death a ſleep, wherein Man's Senſes be (as it were,) taken from him for a ſeaſon, and yet when he awaketh, he is more freſh than he was when he went to Bed. So, although we have our Souls ſeparated from our Bodies for a ſeaſon, yet at the general Reſurrection we ſhall be more freſh, beautiful, and perfect than we be now. For now we be mortal, then ſhall we be immortal: Now infected with divers Infirmities, then clearly void of all mortal Infirmities: Now we be ſubject to all carnal deſires, then we ſhall be all Spiritual, deſiring nothing but God's Glory, and things eternal. Thus is this bodily death a door or entring unto Life, and therefore not ſo much dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful (if it be rightly conſidered,) as it is comforta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; not a miſchief, but a Remedy for all miſchief; no Enemy, but a Friend; not a cruel Tyrant, but a gentle Guide, leading us not to mortality, but to immortality; not to Sorrow and Pain, but to Joy and Pleaſure, and that to endure for ever, if it be thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:54673:53"/> taken and accepted as God's Meſſenger, and patiently born of us for Chriſt's Love, that ſuffered moſt painful death for our Love, to redeem us from death eternal. Accordingly hereunto <hi>St. Paul</hi> ſaith,<note place="margin">Col. 3.</note> 
                        <hi>Our Life is hid with Chriſt in God: But when our Life ſhall appear, then ſhall we alſo appear with him in Glory.</hi> Why then ſhall we fear to die, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering the manifold and comfortable Promiſes of the Goſpel, and of Holy Scriptures?<note place="margin">1 John 5.</note> 
                        <hi>God the Father hath given us everlaſting Life,</hi> (ſaith <hi>St. John,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">1 John 5.</note>) <hi>and this Life is in his Son. He that hath the Son, hath Life; and he that hath not the Son, hath not Life. And this I write</hi> (ſaith <hi>St. John,) to you that believe in the Name of the Son of God, that you may know, that you have everlaſting Life, and that you do believe upon the Name of the Son of God.</hi> And our Saviour Chriſt ſaith,<note place="margin">John 5.</note> 
                        <hi>He that believeth in me, hath Life everlaſting, and I will raiſe him from Death to Life at the laſt day: St. Paul</hi> alſo ſaith,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 1.</note> 
                        <hi>That Chriſt is ordained and made of God our Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs, or Holineſs and Redemption, to the intent that he which will glory ſhould glory in the Lord. St. Paul</hi> did contemn and ſet little by all other things,<note place="margin">Phil. 3.</note> 
                        <hi>eſteeming them as Dung,</hi> which before he had in ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry great price, that <hi>he might be found in Chriſt,</hi> to have everlaſting Life, true Holineſs, Righteouſneſs, and Redemption. Finally, <hi>St. Paul</hi> maketh a plain Argument on this wiſe,<note place="margin">Rom. 8.</note> 
                        <hi>If our heavenly Father would not ſpare his own natural Son, but did give him to death for us; how can it it be, but that with him he ſhould give us all things?</hi> Therefore if we have Chriſt, then have we with him, and by him, all good things whatſoever we can in our Hearts wiſh or deſire, as Victory over Death, Sin, and Hell: We have the Favour of God, Peace with him, Holineſs, Wiſdom, Juſtice, Power, Life, and Redemption, we have by him perpetual Health, Wealth, Joy, and Bliſs ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting.</p>

                     <head>The Second Part of the Sermon againſt the Fear of Death.</head>
                     <p>IT hath been heretofore ſhewed you, That there be three Cauſes wherefore Men do commonly fear Death. Firſt, the ſorrowful departing from World<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Goods and Pleaſures. The Second, the fear of the pangs and pains that come with Death. The laſt and principal Cauſe is, The horrible fear of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme Miſery, and perpetual Damnation in time to come. And yet none of theſe three Cauſes troubleth good Men, becauſe they ſtay themſelves by true Faith, perfect Charity, and ſure Hope of the endleſs Joy and Bliſs everlaſting.</p>
                     <p>All thoſe therefore have great cauſe to be full of Joy, that be joyned to Chriſt with true Faith, ſted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faſt Hope, and perfect Charity; and not to fear death, nor everlaſting Damnation. For Death cannot de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prive them of Jeſus Chriſt, nor can any Sin condemn them that are grafted ſurely in him, which is their on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Joy, Treaſure, and Life. Let us repent of our Sins, amend our Lives, truſt in his Mercy and Satisfaction; and Death, can neither take him from us, nor us from him. For then, (as <hi>St. Paul</hi> ſaith,) <hi>Whether we live or die, we be the Lords own.</hi> And again he ſaith, <hi>Chriſt did die, and roſe again, becauſe he ſhould be Lord both of the dead and quick.</hi> Then if we be the Lords own when we be dead, it muſt needs fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, that ſuch temporal death not only cannot harm us, but alſo that it ſhall be much to our profit, and joyn us unto God more perfectly. And thereof the Chriſtian Heart may ſurely be certified by the infallible or undeceivable Truth of Holy Scripture. <hi>It is God</hi> (ſaith <hi>St. Paul,) which hath prepared us unto immortality, and the ſame is he which hath gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven us a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

But we have a courage and deſire rather to be at home with God and our Saviour Chriſt, far from the Body, where we may behold his Godhead as he is, Face to Face, to our everlaſting Comfort. Theſe be <hi>St. Paul</hi>'s words in effect, whereby we may perceive, that the Life in this World is reſembled and likened to a Pilgrimage in a ſtrange Country, far from God; and that Death, delivering us from our Bodies, doth ſend us ſtrait home into our own Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, and maketh us to dwell preſently with God for ever, in everlaſting Reſt and Quietneſs: So that to die is no loſs, but profit and winning, to all true Chriſtian People. What loſt the Thief that died on the Croſs with Chriſt, by his Bodily death? Yea, how much did he gain by it? Did not our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour ſay unto him,<note place="margin">Luke 16.</note> 
                        <hi>This day thou ſhalt be with me in Paradiſe?</hi> And <hi>Lazarus</hi> that pitiful Perſon, that lay before the Rich Man's Gate, pained with Sores, and pined with Hunger, did not death highly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit and promote him, which by the miniſtry of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels ſent him unto <hi>Abraham</hi>'s Boſom, a place of Reſt, Joy, and Heavenly Conſolation? Let us think none other, (good Chriſtian People,) but Chriſt hath pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared, and made ready before, the ſame Joy and Felicity for us, that he prepared for <hi>Lazarus</hi> and the Thief. Wherefore, let us ſtick unto his Salvation, and Gracious Redemption, and believe his Word; Serve him from our Hearts: Love and Obey him, and whatſoever we have done heretofore contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to his moſt Holy Will, now let us Repent in time, and hereafter ſtudy to Correct our Life: and doubt not, but we ſhall find him as merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful unto us, as he was either to <hi>Lazarus</hi> or to the Thief, whoſe examples are written in Holy Scripture, for the comfo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Thus I truſt every Chriſtian Man per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiveth by the infallible or undeceivable Word of God, that Bodily death cannot harm nor hinder them that truly believe in Chriſt, but contrarily ſhall profit and promote the Chriſtian Souls, which being truly penitent for their offences, depart hence in perfect Charity, and in ſure Truſt, that God is merciful to them, forgiving their Sins, for the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits of Jeſus Chriſt his only natural Son.</p>

                        <note place="margin">The Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Cauſe why ſome do fear death.</note>The Second Cauſe why ſome do fear death, is ſore ſickneſs, and grievous pains, which partly come before death, and partly accompany, or come with, death, whenſoever it cometh. This fear, is the fear of the frail fleſh, and a natural paſſion belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing unto the nature of a mortal Man. But true Faith in God's promiſes, and regard of the pains and pangs which Chriſt upon the Croſs ſuffered for us miſerable ſinners, with conſideration of the Joy and everlaſting Life to come in Heaven, will mitigate thoſe pains, and moderate this fear, that it ſhall never be able to overthrow the hearty de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire and gladneſs, that the Chriſtian Soul hath to be ſeparated from this corrupt Body, that it may come to the Gracious Preſence of our Saviour Jeſus Chriſt. If we believe ſtedfaſtly the Word of God, we ſhall perceive that ſuch bodily ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, pangs of death, or whatſoever dolorous pangs we ſuffer, either before, or with death, be nothing elſe in Chriſtian Men, but the rod of our Heavenly and Loving Father, wherewith he mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifully correcteth us, either to try and declare the Faith of his patient Children, that they may be ſound Laudable, Glorious, and Honourable in his Sight, when Jeſus Chriſt ſhall be openly ſhewed to be the Judge of all the World, or elſe to cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtiſe and amend in them whatſoever offendeth his
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:54673:55"/> Fatherly and Gracious Goodneſs, leſt they ſhould periſh everlaſtingly. And this his correcting rod is common to all Men that be truly his. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore let us caſt away the burden of Sin that lieth too heavy on our necks, and return unto God by true penance and amendment of our lives; Let us with patience run this courſe that is appointed, ſuffering (for his ſake that dyed for our Salvation,) all ſorrows and pangs of death, and death itſelf joyfully, when God ſendeth it to us, having our Eyes fixed and ſet faſt ever upon the Head and Captain of our Faith, Jeſus Chriſt:<note place="margin">Phil. 2.</note> Who (conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering the Joy that he ſhould come unto,) cared neither <hi>for the ſhame nor pain of death,</hi> but wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly conforming and framing his Will to his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers Will, moſt patiently ſuffered the moſt ſhame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and painful death of the Croſs, being innocent and harmleſs. And now therefore he is exalted in Heaven, and everlaſtingly ſitteth on the right hand of the Throne of God the Father. Let us call to our remembrance therefore the Life and Joyes of Heaven, that are kept for all them that patiently do ſuffer here with Chriſt, and conſider that Chriſt ſuffered all his painful paſſion by ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, and for ſinners: And then we ſhall with Patience, and the more eaſily, ſuffer ſuch ſorrows and pains, when they come. Let us not ſet at light the chaſtiſing of the Lord, nor grudge at him, nor fall from him, when of him we be corrected: For the Lord loveth them whom he doth correct, and beateth every one whom he taketh to be his Child. <hi>What Child is that,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Heb. 12.</note> (ſaith <hi>St. Paul,) whom the Father loveth, and doth not chaſtiſe?

                     </p>
                     <p>Therefore ſeeing, that when we have on Earth our carnal Fathers to be our correctors, we do fear them, and reverently take their correction;
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:54673:56"/> ſhall we not much more be in Subjection to God our Spiritual Father, by whom we ſhall have ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting Life? and our Carnal Fathers ſomtimes cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect us, even as it pleaſeth them, without cauſe: But this Father juſtly correcteth us, either for our Sin, to the intent we ſhould amend, or for our Commodity and Wealth, to make us thereby par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takers of his Holineſs. Furthermore, all Correcti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which God ſendeth us in this preſent time, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth to have no Joy and Comfort, but Sorrow and Pain, yet it bringeth with it a taſt of God's Mercy and Goodneſs, towards them that be ſo corrected, and a ſure hope of God's everlaſting Conſolation in Heaven.

                     <p>IN this Sermon againſt the fear of Death, Two Cauſes were declared, which commonly move worldly Men to be in much fear to die, and yet the ſame do nothing trouble the faithful and good Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers when Death cometh, but rather give them oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion greatly to rejoice, conſidering that they ſhall be delivered from the ſorrow and miſery of this World, and be brought to the great Joy and Feli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:54673:56"/> of the Life to come.<note place="margin">The Third Cauſe why Death is to be feared.</note> Now the Third and ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial Cauſe, why Death indeed is to be feared, is the miſerable State of the worldly and ungodly People, after their Death: But this is no Cauſe at all, why the godly and faithful People ſhould fear Death, but rather contrariwiſe, their godly Converſation in this Life, and Belief in Chriſt, cleaving continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally to his Mercies, ſhould make them to long ſore after that Life, that remaineth for them undoubted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly after this bodily Death. Of this immortal State, (after this tranſitory Life,) where we ſhall live evermore in the Preſence of God, in Joy, and Reſt, after Victory over all Sickneſs, Sorrows, Sin, and Death: There be many plain places of Holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, which confirm the weak Conſcience againſt the fear of all ſuch Dolours, Sickneſſes, Sin, and bodily Death, to aſſwage ſuch trembling and ungod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly fear, and to encourage us with Comfort and hope of a bleſſed State after this Life. Saint <hi>Paul</hi> wiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth unto the <hi>Epheſians,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Epheſ. 1.</note> That <hi>God the Father of Glory, would give unto them the Spirit of Wiſdom and Revelation, that the Eyes of their Hearts might give Light to know him, and to perceive how great things he had called them unto, and how rich an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance he hath prepared after this Life for them that pertain unto him.</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Phil. 1.</note> And St. <hi>Paul</hi> himſelf de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clareth the deſire of his Heart, which was to <hi>be diſſolved and looſed from his Body, and to be with Chriſt, which</hi> (as he ſaid,) <hi>was much better for him, although to them it was more neceſſary that he ſhould live,</hi> which he refuſed not for their ſakes.

                     <p>Now the Holy Fathers of the Old Law, and all faithful and righteous Men, which departed before our Saviour Chriſt's Aſcenſion into Heaven, did, by Death, depart from Troubles unto Reſt, from the hands of their Enemies, into the hands of God,
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:54673:57"/> from Sorrows and Sickneſſes, unto joyful refreſhing in <hi>Abraham</hi>'s boſom, a place of all Comfort and Conſolation, as the Scriptures do plainly by manifeſt words teſtifie.<note place="margin">Wiſdom 3.</note> The Book of Wiſdom ſaith, That the Righteous Mens Souls be in the hand of God, and no torment ſhall touch them. They ſeemed to the eyes of fooliſh Men to die, and their death was counted miſerable, and their departing out of this World wretched, but they be in Reſt.

And in another place the ſame Book ſaith, The Righteous, though he be prevented with ſuddain Death, nevertheleſs he ſhall be there where he ſhall be refreſhed. Of <hi>Abraham</hi>'s Boſom, Chriſt's words be ſo plain, that a Chriſtian Man needeth no more proof of it. Now then, if this were the ſtate of the Holy Fathers and Righteous Men, before the coming of our Saviour, and before he was Glorified: How much more then ought all we to have a ſtedfaſt Faith, and a ſure Hope of this bleſſed ſtate and condition, after our death?

                     <p>ALmighty God hath appointed and Created all things in Heaven, Earth, and Waters, in a moſt excellent and perfect Order.

The Earth, Trees, Seeds, Plants, Herbs, Corn, Graſs, and all manner of Beaſts, keep themſelves in order. All the parts of the whole year, as Winter, Summer, Months, Nights and Days, continue in their order: All kinds of Fiſhes in the Sea, Rivers and Waters; with all Fountains, Springs, yea, the Seas themſelves keep their comly courſe and order: And Man himſelf alſo hath all his Parts, both within and without, as Soul, Heart, Mind, Memory, Underſtanding, Reaſon, Speech, with all and ſingular corporal Members of his Body, in a profitable, neceſſary, and pleaſant Order: Eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry degree of People in their Vocation, Calling, and Office, hath appointed to them their Duty and Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der: Some are in high degree, ſome in low, ſome Kings and Princes, ſome Inferiours and Subjects, Prieſts, and Lay-men, Maſters and Servants, Fathers and Children, Husbands and Wi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="106" facs="tcp:54673:60"/> and every one have need of other, ſo that in all things is to be lauded and praiſed the goodly order of God, without the which, no Houſe, no City, no Common-wealth, can continue and endure, or laſt. For where there is no right order, there reigneth all Abuſe, Carnal liberty, Enormity, Sin, and Babyloni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal confuſion. Take away Kings, Princes, Rulers, Magiſtrates, Judges, and ſuch Eſtates of God's order, no Man ſhall ride or go by the way unrobbed, no Man ſhall ſleep in his own Houſe or Bed unkilled, no Man ſhall keep his Wife, Children, and Poſſeſſions in quietneſs, all things ſhall be common, and there muſt needs follow all miſchief and utter deſtruction, both of Souls, Bodies, Goods, and Common-wealths. But bleſſed be God, that we, in this Realm of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> feel not the horrible Calamities, Miſeries, and Wretchedneſs, which all they undoubtedly feel and ſuffer, that lack this godly order: And praiſed be God, that we know the great excellent Benefit of God ſhewed towards us in this behalf. God hath ſent us his high gift, our moſt dear Sovereign King <hi>JAMES,</hi> with a godly, wife, and honorable Council, with other Superiors and Inferiors, in a beautiful order, and godly. Wherefore, let us Subjects do our bounden Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, giving hearty thanks to God, and praying for the preſervation of this godly order. Let us all obey, even from the bottom of our Hearts, all their godly Proceedings, Laws, Statutes, Proclamations, and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junctions, with all other godly orders. Let us con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider the Scriptures of the Holy Ghoſt, which per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuade and command us all obediently to be ſubject, firſt and chiefly to the King's Majeſty, Supreme Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernor over all, and next to his honorable Council, and to all other Noble Men, Magiſtrates and Officers, which by God's goodneſs be placed and ordered: For Almighty God is the only Author and Provider for this fore-named State and Order, as it is writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten of God in the Book of the <hi>Proverbs:</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Prov. 8.</note> 
                        <hi>Through me Kings do reign,</hi> through me Counſellers make juſt Laws, through me do Princes bear Rule, and all Judges
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:54673:60"/> of the Earth execute Judgement, I am loving to them that love me. Here let us mark well, and remember, that the high Power and Authority of Kings, with their making of Laws, Judgements and Offices, are the Ordinances not of Man, but of God: And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore is this Word <hi>(through me,)</hi> ſo many times repeated. Here is alſo well to be conſidered and remembred, that this good Order is appointed by God's Wiſdom, Favor and Love, eſpecially for them that love God, and therefore he ſaith, I love them that love me.<note place="margin">Wiſd. 6.</note> Alſo in the Book of Wiſdom we may evidently learn, that a King's Power, Authority and Strength, is a great Benefit of God, given of his great Mercy, to the comfort of our great Miſery. For this we read there ſpoken to Kings, Hear, O ye Kings, and underſtand, learn ye that be Judges of the ends of the Earth, give ear, ye that Rule the Multitudes: For the Power is given you of the Lord, and the Strength from the Higheſt. Let us learn alſo here by the Infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible and undeceivable Word of God, That Kings, and other Supreme and higher Officers, are or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained of God, who is moſt high: And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they are here taught diligently to apply and give themſelves to Knowledge and Wiſdom, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary for the ordering of God's People to their governance committed, or whom to govern they are charged of God. And they be here alſo taught by Almighty God, that they ſhould acknowledge themſelves to have all their Power and Strength not from <hi>Rome,</hi> but immediately of God moſt High. We read in the Book of <hi>Deuteronomy,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Deut. 33.</note> that all Puniſhment pertaineth to God, by this Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence, <hi>Vengeance is mine, and I will reward.</hi> But this Sentence, we muſt underſtand to pertain alſo unto the Magiſtrates which do exerciſe God's room in Judgement, and puniſhing by good and godly Laws here on Earth. And the places of Scripture which ſeem to remove from among all Chriſtian Men, Judgement, Puniſhment, or Killing, ought
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:54673:61"/> to be underſtood, that no Man (of his own private Authority,) may be Judge over others, may puniſh, or may kill. But we muſt refer all Judgment to God, to Kings and Rulers, Judges under them which be God's Officers to execute Juſtice; and by plain words of Scripture, have their Authority and Uſe of the Sword Granted from God, as we are taught by <hi>St. Paul,</hi> that dear and choſen Apoſtle of our Saviour Chriſt, whom we ought diligently to obey even as we would obey our Saviour Chriſt if he were preſent. Thus <hi>St. Paul</hi> writeth to the <hi>Romans, Let every Soul ſubmit himſelf unto the authority of the higher,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Rom. 13.</note> 
                        <hi>powers for there is no power but of God. The powers that be, be ordained of God. Whoſoever there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore withſtandeth the Power, withſtandeth the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance of God: But they that reſiſt, or are againſt it, ſhall receive to themſelves damnation. For Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers are not fearful to them that do good, but to them that do evil. Wilt thou be without fear of the Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er? Do well then, and ſo ſhalt thou be praiſed of the ſame, for he is the Miniſter of God, for thy wealth. But, and if thou do that which is evil, then fear, for he beareth not the Sword for nought, for he is the Miniſter of God, to take vengeance on him that doth evil. Wherefore ye muſt needs obey, not only for fear of vengeance, but alſo becauſe of conſcience, and even for this cauſe pay ye tribute, for they are God's Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, ſerving for the ſame purpoſe.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Here let us learn of <hi>St. Paul,</hi> the choſen Veſſel of God, that all Perſons having Souls (he except<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth none, nor exempteth none, neither Prieſt, Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle, nor Prophet, ſaith <hi>St. Chryſoſtom,</hi>) do owe of bounden Duty, and even in Conſcience, Obedience, Submiſſion, and Subjection to the <hi>higher Powers which be ſet in autho ty by God;</hi> foraſmuch as they be God's Lieutenants, God's Preſidents, God's Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers, God's Commiſſioners, God's Judges, ordain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of God himſelf, of whom only they have all their Power, and all their Authority.

                     <head>The Second Part of the Sermon of Obedience.</head>
                     <p>FOraſmuch as God hath created and diſpoſed all things in a comly order, we have been taught in the Firſt Part of the Sermon, concerning good Order and Obedience; that we ought alſo in all Commonweals, to obſerve and keep a due order, and to be obedient to the Powers, their Ordinances and Laws, and that all Rulers are appointed of God, for a goodly Order to be kept in the World: And alſo how the Magiſtrates ought to learn how to Rule and Govern according to God's Laws: And that all Subjects are bound to obey them as God's Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, yea, although they be evil, not only for fear, but alſo for Conſcience ſake. And here, good Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, let us all mark diligently, that it is not lawful for Inferiors and Subjects, in any caſe to reſiſt and ſtand againſt the Superior Powers: For <hi>S. Paul</hi>'s words be plain, that <hi>whoſoever withſtandeth, ſhall get to themſelves damnation, for whoſoever withſtandeth, withſtandeth the Ordinance of God.</hi> Our Saviour Chriſt himſelf, and his Apoſtles, received many and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers injuries of the unfaithful and wicked Men in Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, yet we never read, that they, or any of them cauſed any Sedition or Rebellion againſt Authority. We read oft, that they patiently ſuffered all troubles, vexations, ſlanders, pangs and pains, and death it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf obediently without tumult or reſiſtance. They committed their Cauſe to him that judgeth righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſly, and prayed for their Enemies heartily and earneſtly. They knew, that the Authority of the
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:54673:62"/> Powers, was God's Ordinance, and therefore both in their Words and Deeds, they taught ever Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to it, and never taught nor did the contrary. The wicked Judge <hi>Pilate</hi> ſaid to Chriſt, <hi>Knoweſt thou not, that I have power to crucifie thee, and have power alſo to looſe thee? Jeſus anſwered, Thou couldſt have no power at all againſt me, except it were given thee from above.</hi> Whereby Chriſt taught us plainly, that even the wicked Rulers have their Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er and Authority from God, and therefore it is not lawful for their Subjects to withſtand them, although they abuſe their Power: Much leſs then is it lawful for Subjects, to withſtand their Godly and Chriſtian Princes, which do not abuſe their Authority, but uſe the ſame to God's Glory, and to the Profit and Commodity of God's People.<note place="margin">1. Pet. 2.</note> The Holy Apoſtle <hi>Peter</hi> commandeth <hi>Servants to be obedient to their Maſters, not only if they be good and gentle, but alſo if they be evil and froward:</hi> Affirming, that the Vocation and Calling of God's People is to be Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient, and of the ſuffering ſide. And there he bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth in the Patience of our Saviour Chriſt, to perſuade Obedience to Governors, yea, although they be wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and wrong-doers. But let us now hear <hi>St. Peter</hi> himſelf ſpeak, for his words certifie beſt our Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, thus he uttereth them in his firſt Epiſtle, <hi>Servants,</hi>

                        <hi>obey your Maſters with fear, not only if they be good and gentle, but alſo if they be froward. For it is thank-worthy, if a man for Conſcience toward God, endureth grief, and ſuffer wrong undeſerved: For what praiſe is it, when ye be beaten for your faults; if ye take it patiently? But when ye do well, if you then ſuffer wrong, and take it patiently, then is there cauſe to have thank of God, for hereunto verily were ye called: For ſo did Chriſt ſuffer for us, leaving us an example, that we ſhould follow his ſteps.</hi> All theſe be the very words of <hi>St. Peter.</hi>

<pb n="111" facs="tcp:54673:62"/> jeopardy and danger of his Life by King <hi>Saul</hi> and his People; yet he neither withſtood, neither uſed any force or violence againſt King <hi>Saul,</hi> his mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal and deadly enemy; but did ever to his Liege Lord and Maſter King <hi>Saul,</hi> moſt true, moſt dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent, and moſt faithful Service. Inſomuch, that when the Lord God had given King <hi>Saul</hi> into <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi>'s hands in his own Cave, he would not hurt him, when he might without all Bodily peril, ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily have ſlain him; no, he would not ſuffer one of his Servants once to lay their hand: upon King <hi>Saul,</hi> but prayed to God on this wiſe, Lord, keep me from doing that thing upon my Maſter, the Lord's Anointed; keep me that I lay not my hand upon him, ſeeing he is the Anointed of the Lord: For as truly as the Lord liveth, (except the Lord ſmite him, or except his day come, or that he go down to War, and periſh in Battel,) the Lord be merciful unto me, <hi>that I lay not my hands upon the Lords Anointed.</hi> And that <hi>David</hi> might have kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led his Enemy King <hi>Saul,</hi> it is evidently proved in the firſt Book of the <hi>Kings,</hi> both by the cutting off the lap of <hi>Saul's</hi> Garment, and alſo by plain Confeſſion of King <hi>Saul.</hi> Alſo another time, as is mentioned in the ſame Book, when the moſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merciful, and moſt unkind, King <hi>Saul</hi> did perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute poor <hi>David;</hi> God did again give <hi>Saul</hi> into <hi>David's</hi> hands, by caſting of King <hi>Saul</hi> and his whole Army into a dead ſleep, ſo that <hi>David</hi> and one <hi>Abiſai</hi> with him came in the night into <hi>Saul</hi>'s Hoſt, where <hi>Saul</hi> lay ſleeping, and his Spear ſtuck in the ground at his Head: Then ſaid <hi>Abiſai</hi> unto <hi>David, God hath delivered thine Enemy into thine hands at this time, now therefore let me ſmite him once with my ſpear to the earth, and I will not ſmite him again the ſecond time;</hi> meaning there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by to have killed him with one ſtroke, and to have made him ſure for ever. And <hi>David</hi> anſwered and ſaid to <hi>Abiſai, Deſtroy him not, for who can lay his hands on the Lords anointed, and be guiltleſs?</hi> And <hi>David</hi> ſaid
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:54673:63"/> furthermore, <hi>As ſure as the Lord liveth, the Lord ſhall ſmite him, or his day ſhall come to die, or he ſhall deſcend or go down into Battel, and there periſh, the Lord keep me from laying my hands upon the Lord's anointed. But take thou now the ſpear that is at his head, and the cruſe of Water, and let us go:</hi> And ſo he did. Here is evidently proved, that we may not withſtand, nor in any ways hurt an anointed King, which is God's Lieutenant, Vicegerent, and higheſt Miniſter in that Country where he is King, But peradventure ſome here would ſay, that <hi>David</hi> in his own defence might have killed King <hi>Saul</hi> lawfully,<note place="margin">An Obje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.</note> and with a ſafe Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience. But holy <hi>David</hi> did know, than he might in no wiſe withſtand,<note place="margin">An An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer.</note> hurt, or kill his Sovereign Lord and King: He did know, that he was but King <hi>Saul</hi>'s Subject, though he were in great favour with God, and his Enemy King <hi>Saul</hi> out of God's favour. Therefore though he were never ſo much provoked, yet he refuſed utterly to hurt the Lord's anointed. He durſt not for offending God and his own Conſcience (although he had occaſion and op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity,) once lay his hands upon God's high Officer the King, whom he did know to be a Perſon reſerved and kept (for his Office ſake,) only to God's Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment and Judgment, therefore he prayeth ſo oft, and ſo earneſtly, that he <hi>lay not his hands upon the Lord's anointed.</hi> And by theſe two Examples, Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>David</hi> (being named in Scripture <hi>a Man after God's own Heart,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Pſal. 88.</note>) giveth a general Rule and Leſſon to all Subjects in the World, not to withſtand their Liege Lord and King, not to take a Sword by their private Authority againſt their King, God's anointed, who only beareth the Sword by God's Authority, for the <hi>Maintenance of the good, and for the Puniſhment of the evil,</hi> who, only by God's Law, hath the uſe of the Sword at his command, and alſo hath all Power, Juriſdiction, Regiment, Correction and Puniſhment, as Supreme Governor of all his Realms and Domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and that even by the Authority of God, and by God's Ordinances. Yet another notable Story and
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:54673:63"/> Doctrine is in the ſecond Book of the Kings, that maketh alſo for this purpoſe. When an <hi>Amalekite,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">2 Kings 1.</note> by King <hi>Saul</hi>'s own conſent and Commandment, had killed King <hi>Saul;</hi> he went to <hi>David,</hi> ſuppoſing to have had great Thanks for his Meſſage, that he had killed David's deadly Enemy, and therefore he made great haſte to tell to <hi>David</hi> the chance, bringing with him King <hi>Saul</hi>'s Crown that was upon his Head, and his Bracelet that was upon his Arm, to perſuade his tidings to be true. But Godly <hi>David</hi> was ſo far from rejoycing at this news, that immediately, and forthwith he rent his Cloaths off his Back, he Mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and wept, and ſaid to the Meſſenger, <hi>How is it, that thou waſt not afraid to lay thy hands on the Lords anointed to deſtroy him?</hi> And by and by <hi>David</hi> made one of his Servants to kill the Meſſenger, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>Thy blood be on thine own head, for thine own mouth hath teſtified and witneſſed againſt thee, grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that thou haſt ſlain the Lords anointed.</hi> Theſe examples being ſo manifeſt and evident, it is an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tolerable ignorance, madneſs, and wickedneſs for Subjects to make any Murmuring, Rebellion, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance, or withſtanding Commotion or Inſurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction againſt their moſt dear and moſt dread Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign Lord and King, ordained and appointed of God's Goodneſs for their Commodity, Peace, and Quietneſs. Yet let us believe undoubtedly, (good Chriſtian People,) that we may not obey Kings, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates, or any other, (though they be our own Fathers,) if they would command us to do any thing contrary to God's Commanments. In ſuch a caſe we ought to ſay with the Apoſtle,<note place="margin">Acts 7.</note> 
                        <hi>We muſt rather obey God than man.</hi> But nevertheleſs in that caſe we may not in any wiſe withſtand violently, or rebel againſt Rulers, or make any Inſurrection, Sedition, or Tumults, either by force of Arms, (or other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe,) againſt the Anointed of the Lord, or any of his Officers: But we muſt in ſuch caſe patiently ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer all wrongs, and injuries, referring the Judgment of our Cauſe only to God. Let us fear the terrible
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:54673:64"/> Puniſhment of Almighty God againſt Traytors and rebellious Perſons, by the Example of <hi>Korah, Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than,</hi> and <hi>Abiram,</hi> who repined and grudged againſt God's Magiſtrates and Officers, and therefore the <hi>Earth opened and ſwallowed them up alive.</hi> Others for their wicked Murmuring and Rebellion, were, by a ſudden Fire ſent down from God, utterly conſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med.

                     <head>The Third Part of the Sermon of Obedience.</head>
                     <p>YE have heard before, in this Sermon of good Order and Obedience, manifeſtly proved both by the Scriptures and Examples, that all Subjects are bound to obey their Magiſtrates, and for no cauſe to reſiſt, or withſtand, or rebel, or make any Sedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion againſt them; yea, although they be wicked Men. And let no Man think, that he can eſcape unpuniſhed, that committeth Treaſon, Conſpiracy, or Rebellion againſt his Sovereign Lord the King, though he commit the ſame never ſo ſecretly, either in Thought, Word, or Deed, never ſo privily in his privy Chamber by himſelf, or openly communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting and conſulting with others. For Treaſon will not be hid, Treaſon will out at length: God will have that moſt deteſtable Vice both opened and puniſhed, for that it is ſo directly againſt his Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance, and againſt his high Principal Judge,
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:54673:64"/> and Anointed on Earth. The Violence and Inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry that is committed againſt Authority, is commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted againſt God, the Commonweal and the whole Realm, which God will have known, and condignly, or worthily, puniſhed one way or the other. For it is notably written of the wiſe Man in Scripture,<note place="margin">Eccl. 10.</note> in the Book called <hi>Eccleſiaſtes: Wiſh the King no evil in thy Thought, nor ſpeak no hurt of him in thy pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy chamber: For the bird of the air ſhall betray thy voice, and with her feathers ſhall bewray thy words.</hi> Theſe Leſſons and Examples are written for our Learning. Therefore let us all fear the moſt dete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtable vice of Rebellion, ever knowing and remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bring, that he that reſiſteth or withſtandeth com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Authority, reſiſteth or withſtandeth God and his Ordinance, as it may be proved by many other places of Holy Scripture. And here let us take heed that we underſtand not theſe, or ſuch other like places (which ſo ſtraitly command Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to Superiours, and ſo ſtraitly puniſhed Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion, and Diſobedience to the ſame,) to be meant in any condition of the pretenced or colour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Power of the Biſhop of <hi>Rome.</hi> For truly the Scripture of God alloweth no ſuch Uſurped Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, full of Enormities, Abuſions, and Blaſphemies. But the true meaning of theſe and ſuch places be, to extol and ſet forth God's true Ordinance, and the Authority of God's Anointed Kings, and of their Officers appointed under them. And con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Uſurped Power of the Biſhop of <hi>Rome,</hi> which he moſt wrongfully challengeth, as the ſucceſſor of Chriſt and <hi>Peter:</hi> We may eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly perceive how falſe, feigned, and forged it is, not only in that it hath no ſufficient ground in Holy Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, but alſo by the Fruits and Doctrine thereof. For our Saviour Chriſt and <hi>St. Peter</hi> teach moſt earneſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and agreeably Obedience to Kings, as to the chief and Supreme Rulers in this world, next under God: But the Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi> teacheth, that they that are under him, are free from all burdens and charges of the
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:54673:65"/> Commonwealth, and Obedience toward their Prince, moſt clearly againſt Chriſt's Doctrine and <hi>St. Peters.</hi> He ought therefore rather to be called Antichriſt, and the Succeſſor of the Scribes and Phariſes, than Chriſt's Vicar, and <hi>St. Peter</hi>'s Succeſſor: Seeing that not only in this point, but alſo in other weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty matters of Chriſtian Religion, in matters of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion and Forgiveneſs of Sins, and of Salvation, he teacheth ſo directly againſt both <hi>St. Peter,</hi> and againſt our Saviour Chriſt, who not only taught Obedience to Kings, but alſo practiſed Obedience in their Converſation and Living: For we read, that they both paid Tribute to the King: And alſo we read that the Holy Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi>

But he would rather ſuffer death, (than ſee God ſo diſhonored, by the breaking of his Holy Precept and Commandment,) than to ſuffer Whoredom to be unrebuked, even in a King. If Whoredom had been but a Paſtime, a Dalliance, and not to be paſſed of, (as many count it now a days,) truly <hi>John</hi> had been more than twice mad, if he would have had the diſpleaſure of a King, if he would have been caſt in Priſon, and loſt his Head for a trifle. But <hi>John</hi> new right well, how filthy, and ſtinking, and abominable the Sin of Whore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom is in the ſight of God, therefore would he not leave it unrebuked, no not in a King. If Whoredom be not lawful in a King, neither is it lawful in a Subject. If Whoredom be not lawful in a publick or common Officer, neither is it lawful in a private Perſon. If it be not lawful neither in King, nor Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, neither in common Officer, nor private Perſon,
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:54673:68"/> truly then it is lawful in no Man nor Woman, of whatſoever Degree or Age they be. Furthermore in the Acts of the Apoſtles we read,<note place="margin">Acts 15.</note> That when the Apoſtles and Elders with the whole Congregation, were gathered together to pacifie the hearts of the faithful dwelling at <hi>Antioch,</hi> (which were diſquieted through the falſe Doctrine of ſeveral Jewiſh Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers,) they ſent word to the Brethren, <hi>That it ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed good to the Holy Ghoſt, and to them, to charge them with no more than with neceſſary things: Among others, they willed them to abſtain from Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry and Fornication, from which,</hi> (ſaid they,) <hi>if you keep your ſelves, ye ſhall do well.</hi> Note here, how theſe holy and bleſſed Fathers of Chriſt's Church would charge the Congregation with no more things than were neceſſary. Mark alſo, how among thoſe things, from the which they commanded the Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren of <hi>Antioch</hi> to abſtain, Fornication and Whore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom are numbred. It is therefore neceſſary, by the determination and conſent of the Holy Ghoſt, and the Apoſtles and Elders, with the whole Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that as from Idolatry and Superſtition, ſo like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe we muſt abſtain from Fornication and Whore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom. It is neceſſary unto Salvation, to abſtain from Idolatry: So it is to abſtain from Whoredom. Is there any nigher way to lead unto damnation, than to be an Idolater? No; even ſo, neither is there any nearer way to damnation, than to be a Fornicator and a Whoremonger. Now where are thoſe Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, which ſo lightly eſteem breaking of Wedlock, Whoredom, Fornication, and Adultery? It is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary, ſaith the Holy Ghoſt, the bleſſed Apoſtles, the Elders, with the whole Congregation of Chriſt, it is neceſſary to Salvation, (ſay they,) to abſtain from Whoredom.

He calleth them the Deeds and Works of Darkneſs, not only becauſe they are cuſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mably in Darkneſs,<note place="margin">John 3 Matth. 25.</note> or in the night time, <hi>(for every one that doth evil, hateth the Light, neither cometh he to the Light, leſt his Works ſhould be reproved,)</hi> but that they lead the right way unto that <hi>utter Darkneſs, where weeping and gnaſhing of Teeth ſhall be.</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Rom. 8.</note> And he ſaith in another place of the ſame Epiſtle, <hi>They that are in the Fleſh, cannot pleaſe God: We are Debtors, not to the Fleſh, that we ſhould live af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the Fleſh, for if ye live after the Fleſh, ye ſhall die.</hi>

Levit. 19.</note> Saint <hi>Peter</hi> ſaith, <hi>As he which called you his Holy, even ſo be ye Holy alſo in your Converſation, becauſe it is written, Be ye Holy, for I am Holy.</hi> Hitherto have we heard, how grievous a Sin Fornication and Whoredom is, and how greatly God doth abhor it throughout the whole Scripture: How can it any otherwiſe be than a Sin of moſt abomination, ſeeing it may not once be named among the Chriſtians, much leſs may it in any point be committed. And ſurely, if we would weigh the greatneſs of this Sin, and conſider it in the right kind, we ſhould find the Sin of Whoredom, to be that moſt filthy Lake,
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:54673:70"/> foul Puddle, and ſtinking Sink, whereunto all kinds of Sins and Evils flow, where alſo they have their reſting place and abiding.</p>
                     <p>For hath not the Adulterer a pride in his Whore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom? As the Wiſe Man ſaith, <hi>They are glad when they have done evil,</hi> and rejoyce in things that are ſtark naught. Is not the Adulterer alſo Idle, and delighteth in no Godly exerciſe, but only in that his moſt filthy and beaſtly pleaſure? Is not his Mind pluckt, and utterly drawn away from all virtuous Studies, and fruitful Labours, and only given to car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal and fleſhly imagination? Doth not the Whore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monger give his mind to Gluttony, that he may be the more apt to ſerve his Luſts, and carnal Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures? Doth not the Adulterer give his Mind to Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetouſneſs, and to polling and pilling of others, that he may be the more able to maintain his Harlots and Whores, and to continue in his filthy and unlawful Love? Swelleth he not alſo with Envy againſt others, fearing that his Prey ſhould be allured, and taken away from him? Again, is he not ireful, and reple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed with Wrath and Diſpleaſure, even againſt his beſt beloved, if at any time his beaſtly and deviliſh Requeſt be letted? What Sin, or kind of Sin is it, that is not joyned with Fornication and Whoredom? It is a Monſter of many Heads: It receiveth all kinds of Vices, and refuſeth all kinds of Virtues. If one ſeveral Sin bringeth Damnation, what is to be thought of that Sin which is accompanied with all Evils, and hath waiting on it whatſoever is hate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to God, damnable to Man, and pleaſant to Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan?</p>
                     <p>Great is the Damnation that hangeth over the Heads of Fornicators and Adulterers. What ſhall I ſpeak of other incommodities, which iſſue and flow out of this ſtinking puddle of Whoredom? Is not that Treaſure, which, before all other, is moſt regarded of honeſt Perſons, the good Fame and Name of Man and Woman, loſt through Whore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom? What Patrimony or Livelihood, What Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance,
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:54673:71"/> What Goods, What Riches doth Whoredom ſhortly conſume, and bring to nought? What Vali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>antneſs and Strength is many times made weak, and deſtroyed with Whoredom? What Wit is ſo fine, that is not beſotted and defaced through Whoredom? What Beauty (although it were never ſo excellent,) is not disfigured through Whoredom? Is not Whoredom an enemy to the pleaſant Flower of Youth, and bringeth it not gray Hairs and old Age before the time? What gift of Nature (although it were never ſo precious,) is not corrupted with Whoredom? Come not many foul and moſt loath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome Diſeaſes of Whoredom? From whence come ſo many Baſtards, and miſbegotten Children, to the high diſpleaſure of God, and diſhonour of Holy Wedlock, but of Whoredom? How many con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume all their Subſtance and Goods, and at the laſt fall into ſuch extreme poverty, that afterward they ſteal, and ſo are hanged, through Whoredom? What Contention and Man ſlaughter cometh of Whoredom? How many Maidens be deflowred, How many Wives corrupted, how many Widows defiled through Whoredom? How much is the Publick and Commonweal impoveriſhed and trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled through Whoredom? How much is God's Word contemned and depraved through Whoredom, and Whoremongers? Of this Vice cometh a great part of the Divorces, which (now adays,) be ſo com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly accuſtomed and uſed by Mens private Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, to the great diſpleaſure of God, and the breach of the moſt Holy knot and bond of Matrimony. For when this moſt deteſtable Sin is once crept into the Breaſt of the Adulterer, ſo that he is intangled with unlawful and unchaſt Love; ſtraightways his true and lawful Wife is deſpiſed, her Preſence is ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horred, her company ſtinketh, and is loathſom, whatſoever ſhe doth is diſpraiſed: There is no qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etneſs in the Houſe, ſo long as ſhe is in his ſight: Therefore to make ſhort work, ſhe muſt away, for her Husband can brook her no longer. Thus
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:54673:71"/> through Whoredom, is the honeſt and harmleſs Wife put away, and an Harlot received in her ſtead: And in like ſort, it happeneth many times in the Wife towards her Husband. O Abomination! Chriſt our Saviour, very God and Man, coming to reſtore the Law of his Heavenly Father unto the right ſenſe, underſtanding, and meaning, (among other things,) reformed the abuſe of this Law of God. For where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as the Jews uſed a long ſufferance, by cuſtom, to put away their Wives at their pleaſure, for every cauſe, Chriſt correcting that evil cuſtom did teach, <hi>That if any Man put away his Wife, and marrieth another,</hi>

                     <p>In what caſe then are theſe Adulterers, which, for the love of an Whore, put away their true and lawful Wife, againſt all Law, right Reaſon, and Conſcience?

He will once puniſh this fleſhly and licentious man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of living, and cauſe that this holy Ordinance ſhall be had in Reverence and Honour.

                        <hi>But Whoremongers and Fornicators God will Judge,</hi> that is to ſay, puniſh and condemn.

Notwithſtanding this is ſpoken to the intent that all Men ſhould flee Whoredom, and live in the fear of God: God grant that it may not be ſpoken in vain.</p>

                     <p>IN the Second Part of this Sermon againſt Adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery that was laſt read, you have learned how earneſtly the Scripture warneth us to avoid the ſin of Adultery, and to embrace cleanneſs of Life: And that through Adultery, we fall into all kinds of Sin, and are made Bondſlaves to the Devil: Through cleanneſs of Life we are made members of Chriſt: And finally, how far Adultery bringeth a Man from all Goodneſs, and driveth him headlong into all Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, Miſchief, and Miſery. Now will I declare un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to you in order, with what grievous puniſhments God in times paſt plagued Adultery, and how cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain worldly Princes alſo did puniſh it; that ye may perceive, that Whoredom and Fornication be ſins no leſs deteſtable in the ſight of God, and all good Men, than I have hitherto uttered. In the Firſt Book of <hi>Moſes</hi> we read, <hi>That when Mankind began to be multiplied upon the earth, the Men and W<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                           <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men gave their minds ſo greatly to fleſhly delight and filthy pleaſure, that they lived without all fear of God.</hi> God, ſeeing this their beaſtly and abomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble living, and perceiving that they amended not, but rather increaſed daily more and more in their ſinful and unclean Manners, repented that he had ever made Man: And to ſhew how greatly he ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horreth Adultery, Whoredom, Fornication, and all Uncleanneſs; He made all the Fountains of the deep
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:54673:72"/> Earth to burſt out, and the ſluces of Heaven to be opened, ſo that the Rain came down upon the Earth by the ſpace of forty Days, and forty Nights, and by this means deſtroyed the whole World, and all Mankind, eight Perſons only excepted, that is to ſay, <hi>Noah</hi> the <hi>Preacher of Righteouſneſs,</hi> (as <hi>St. Peter</hi> calleth him,) and his Wife, his three Sons, and their Wives. O what a grievous Plague did God caſt here upon all living Creatures for the ſin of Whore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom! For the which, God took vengeance, not only of Man, but of all Beaſts, Fowls, and all li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Creatures.<note place="margin">Gen. 4.</note> Manſlaughter was committed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, yet was not the World deſtroyed for that: But for Whoredom all the World (few only except,) was overflowed with Waters, and ſo periſhed. An example worthy to be remembred, that ye may learn to fear God.</p>
                     <p>We read again,<note place="margin">Gen. 19.</note> That for the filthy ſin of Unclean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, <hi>Sodom</hi> and <hi>Gomorrha,</hi> and the other Cities nigh unto them, <hi>were deſtroyed by Fire and Brim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone from Heaven;</hi> ſo that there was neither Man, Woman, Child, nor Beaſt, nor yet any thing that grew upon the Earth there, left undeſtroyed; whoſe Heart trembleth not at the hearing of this Hiſtory? Who is ſo drowned in Whoredom and Uncleanneſs, that will not now for ever after leave this abomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble living; ſeeing that God ſo grievouſly puniſheth uncleanneſs, to rain Fire and Brimſtone from Heaven, to deſtroy whole Cities, to kill Man, Woman, and Child, and all other living Creatures there abiding, to conſume with Fire all that ever grew? What can be more manifeſt tokens of God's wrath and ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance againſt Uncleanneſs and impurity of Life? Mark this Hiſtory (good People) and fear the ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance of God.

                        <note place="margin">Gen. 20.</note> Likewiſe we read of <hi>Abimelech</hi> King of <hi>Gerar,</hi> although he touched her not by carnal know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge. Theſe Plagues and Puniſhments did God
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:54673:73"/> caſt upon filthy and unclean Perſons, before the Law was given, (the Law of Nature only reigning in the Hearts of Men,) to declare how great love he had to Matrimony and Wedlock; and again, how much he abhorreth Adultery, Fornication and all Uncleanneſs.<note place="margin">Lev. 22.</note> And when the Law, that forbad Whoredom, was given by <hi>Moſes</hi> to the Jews, did not God command that the breakers thereof ſhould be put to death? The words of the Law be theſe: <hi>Whoſo committeth Adultery with any Man's Wife, ſhall die the death, both the Man and the Woman, becauſe he hath broken Wedlock with his Neighbor's Wife.</hi> In the Law alſo it was commanded, That <hi>a Damoſel and a Man, taken together in Whoredom, ſhould be both ſt<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                        <note place="margin">Numb. 25.</note> In another place we alſo read, that God commanded <hi>Moſes</hi> to take all the head-Rulers and Princes of the People, and <hi>to hang them upon Gibbets openly, that every Man might ſee them,</hi> becauſe they either committed, or did not puniſh Whoredom.

                        <note place="margin">1 Cor. 10.</note>Saint <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>All theſe things are written for our Example,</hi> and to teach us the Fear of God, and the Obedience to his Holy Law. For <hi>if God ſpared not the natural Branches, neither will he ſpare us
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:54673:73"/> that be but Grafts, if we commit the like Offence.</hi> If God deſtroyed many thouſands of People, many Cities, yea the whole World for Whoredom, let us not flatter ourſelves, and think we ſhall eſcape free, and without Puniſhment. For he hath promiſed in his Holy Law, to ſend moſt grievous Plagues upon them that tranſgreſs, or break his Holy Commandments. Thus have we heard how God puniſheth the Sin of Adultery: Let us now hear certain Laws, which the Civil Magiſtrates deviſed in their Countries for the Puniſhment thereof, that we may learn how Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleanneſs hath ever been deteſted in all well-ordered Cities and Common-wealths, and among all honeſt Perſons. The Law among the <hi>Lepreians,</hi> was this, That when any were taken in Adultery,<note place="margin">Laws de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſed for the Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment of Whore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom.</note> they were bound and carried three days through the City, and afterwards, as long as they lived, they were deſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, and, with ſhame and confuſion, counted as Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons void of all honeſty. Among the <hi>Locrenſians,</hi> the Adulterers had both their Eyes thruſt out. The <hi>Romans</hi> in times paſt puniſhed Whoredom, ſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time by Fire, ſomtime by Sword. If any Man among the <hi>Egyptians</hi> had been taken in Adultery, the Law was, That he ſhould openly, in the preſence of all the People, be ſcourged naked with Whips, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the number of a thouſand Stripes; the Woman that was taken with him, had her Noſe cut off, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by ſhe was known ever after to be a Whore, and therefore to be abhorred of all Men. Among the <hi>Arabians,</hi> they that were taken in Adultery had their Heads ſtricken from their Bodies. The <hi>Athe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians</hi> puniſhed Whoredom with death, in like man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner. So likewiſe did the barbarous <hi>Tartarians.</hi> Among the <hi>Turks</hi> even at this day, they that be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken in Adultery, both Man and Woman, are ſtoned ſtraightway to death, without mercy. Thus we ſee, what godly Acts were deviſed in times paſt of the high Powers, for the putting away of Whoredom, and for the maintaining of Holy Matrimony or Wed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lock, and pure Converſation: And the Authors of
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:54673:74"/> theſe Acts were no Chriſtians, but the Heathen: Yet were they ſo enflamed with the love of Honeſty, and pureneſs of Life, that for the maintenance and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation, or keeping up, of that, they made godly Statutes, ſuffering neither Fornication or Adultery to reign in their Realms unpuniſhed. Chriſt ſaid to the People, <hi>The</hi> Ninevites <hi>ſhall riſe at the Judgment with this Nation,</hi> (meaning the unfaithful <hi>Jews,) and ſhall condemn them: For they repented at the Preaching of</hi> Jonas, <hi>but behold,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>a Greater than</hi> Jonas <hi>is here,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Mat. 12.</note> (meaning himſelf,) and yet they repent not. Shall not (think you,) likewiſe the <hi>Locrenſians, Arabians, Athenians,</hi> with ſuch other, riſe up in the Judgment, and condemn us, foraſmuch as they ceaſed from their Whoredom at the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment of Man, and we have the Law and mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt Precepts and Commandments of God, and yet forſake we not our filthy Converſation? Truly, tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, it ſhall be eaſier at the day of Judgment to theſe Heathens, than to us, except we repent and amend. For though death of Body ſeemeth unto us a grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous Puniſhment in this World for Whoredom: Yet is that pain nothing in compariſon to the grievous Torments, which Adulterers, Fornicators, and all unclean Perſons, ſhall ſuffer after this Life. For all ſuch ſhall be excluded and ſhut out of the Kingdom of Heaven,<note place="margin">1 Col. 6. Galat. 5. Eph. 5.</note> as Saint <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>Be not deceived, for neither Whoremongers nor Worſhippers of Images, nor Adulterers, nor effeminate Perſons, nor Sodomites, nor Thieves, nor covetous Perſons, nor Drunkards, nor curſed Speakers, nor Revilers, ſhall inherit the Kingdom of God.</hi>

But let us hear how we may eſchew the Sin of Whoredome and Adultery, that we may walk in the Fear of God, and be free from thoſe moſt grievous and intolerable Torments, which abide all unclean Perſons. Now to avoid Fornication, Adultery,<note place="margin">Remedies whereby to avoid Fornicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and Adultery.</note> and all Uncleanneſs, let us provide, that above all things we may keep our Hearts pure and clean, from all evil Thoughts and carnal Luſts: For if that be once in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected and corrupt, we fall headlong into all kind of Ungodlineſs. This ſhall we eaſily do, if, when we feel inwardly, that Satan our old Enemy tempteth us un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Whoredom, we by no means conſent to his crafty Suggeſtions, but valiantly reſiſt and withſtand him by ſtrong Faith in the Word of God: Alledging againſt him always in our Heart, this Commandment of God: <hi>Scriptum eſt, non moechaberis.</hi> It is written, <hi>Thou ſhalt not commit Whoredom.</hi> It ſhall be good alſo for us, ever to live in the Fear of God, and to ſet before our Eyes the grievous Threatnings of God againſt all un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly Sinners, and to conſider in our mind, how fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy, beaſtly, and ſhort that Pleaſure is, whereunto Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan continually ſtirreth and moveth us: And again, how the pain appointed for that Sin is intolerable and everlaſting. Moreover, to uſe a temperance and ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>briety in Eating and Drinking, to eſchew unclean Communication, to avoid all filthy Company, to flee Idleneſs, to delight in reading the Holy Scriptures,
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:54673:75"/> to watch in Godly Prayers, and virtuous Meditation, and at all times, to exerciſe ſome Godly Travels, ſhall help greatly to the eſchewing of Whoredom.</p>
                     <p>And here are all degrees to be moniſhed, whether they be married or unmarried, to love Chaſtity and Cleanneſs of Life. For the married are bound by the Law of God ſo purely to love one another, that neither of them ſeek any ſtrange Love. The Man muſt only cleave to his Wife, and the Wife again on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to her Husband: They muſt ſo delight one in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's Company, that none of them covet any other. And as they are bound thus to live together in all Godlineſs and Honeſty, ſo likewiſe it is their Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, virtuouſly to bring up their Children, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide, that they fall not into Satan's Snare, nor into any Uncleanneſs, but that they come pure and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt unto Holy Wedlock, when time requireth. So likewiſe ought all Maſters and Rulers to provide, that no Whoredom, nor any point of Uncleanneſs, be uſed among their Servants. And again, they that are ſingle, and feel in themſelves, that they cannot live without the Company of a Woman, let them get Wives of their own, and ſo live Godly together: <hi>For it is better to marry than to burn.</hi>

                     <p>THIS day (good Chriſtian People,) ſhall be declared unto you, the unprofitableneſs and ſhameful unhoneſty of Contention, Strife, and Debate; to the intent, that when you ſhall ſee, as it were in a Table painted before your Eyes, the Evil-Favouredneſs and Deformity of this moſt deteſtable Vice, your Stomachs may be moved to riſe againſt it, and to deteſt and abhor that Sin, which is ſo much to be hated, and pernicious, and hurtful to all Men. But among all kinds of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention, none is more hurtful than is Contention in matters of Religion. <hi>Eſchew</hi> (ſaith Saint <hi>Paul,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">1 Tim. 1. 2 Tim. 2.</note>) <hi>fooliſh and unlearned queſtions, knowing that they breed Strife.</hi> It becometh not the <hi>Servant of God to fight, or ſtrive, but to be Meek toward all Men.</hi> This Contention and Strife was in Saint <hi>Paul</hi>'s time among the Corinthians, and is at this time among us Engliſh Men. For too many there be, which, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Ale-benches or other places, delight to ſet forth certain queſtions, not ſo much pertaining to Edifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as to Vain-Glory, and ſhewing forth of their cunning, and ſo unſoberly to reaſon and diſpute, that when neither part will give place to other, they fall to Chiding and Contention, and ſomtime from hot Words to further Inconvenience. Saint <hi>Paul</hi> could
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:54673:76"/> not abide to hear among the Corinthians, theſe words of Diſcord or Diſſention,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 3.</note> 
                        <hi>I hold of</hi> Paul, <hi>I of</hi> Cephas, <hi>and I of</hi> Apollo, What would he then ſay, if he heard theſe words of Contention, (which be now almoſt in every Man's Mouth?) He is a Phariſee, he is a Goſpeller, he is of the new ſort, he is of the Old Faith, he is a new-broched Brother, he is a good Catholick Father, he is a Papiſt, he is an Heretick. O how the Church is divided? O how the Cities be cut and mangled? O how the Coat of Chriſt, that was without Seam, is all to rent and torn? O Body Myſtical of Chriſt, where is that ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and happy unity, out of the which whoſoever is, he is not in Chriſt? If one Member be pulled from another, where is the Body? If the Body be drawn from the Head, where is the Life of the Body? We cannot be joyned to Chriſt our Head, except we be glued with Concord and Charity one to another. For he that is not of this Unity, is not of the Church of Chriſt, which is a Congregation or Unity together, and not a Diviſion.<note place="margin">1 Cor. 3.</note> Saint <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>That as long as Emulation or Envying, Contention, and Factions or Sects be among us, we be carnal, and walk according to the fleſhly Man.</hi>
                        <note place="margin">James 3.</note> And Saint <hi>James</hi> ſaith, <hi>If ye have bitter Emulation or Envying, and Contention in your Hearts, glory not of it; for where Conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is, there is <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nſtedfaſtneſs and all Evil Deeds.</hi> And why do we not hear Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> which prayeth us,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 1.</note> whereas he might command us, ſaying, <hi>I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeech you in the Name of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, that you will ſpeak all one thing, and that there be no diſſention among you, but that you will be one whole Body, of one mind, and of one opinion in the Truth.</hi> If his deſire be reaſonable and honeſt, why do we not grant it? If his requeſt be for our profit, why do we refuſe it? And if we liſt not to hear his Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition of Prayer, yet let us hear his Exhortation, where he ſaith,<note place="margin">Epheſ. 4.</note> 
                        <hi>I exhort you that you walk as it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cometh the Vocation in which you be called, with all Submiſſion and Meekneſs, with Lenity and Softneſs
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:54673:76"/> of Mind, bearing with one another in Charity, ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dying to keep the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity of the Spirit by the Bond of Peace: For there is one Body, one Spirit, one Faith, one Baptiſm.</hi> There is (ſaith he,) but one Body, of the which he can be no lively Member, that is at variance with the other Members. There is one Spirit, which joyneth and knitteth all things in one. And how can this one Spirit reign in us, when we among ourſelves be divided? There is but one Faith, and how can we then ſay, He is of the Old Faith, and he is of the New Faith? There is but one Baptiſm, and then ſhall not all they, which be Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized, be one? Contention cauſeth Diviſion, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it ought not to be among Chriſtians, whom one Faith and Baptiſm joyneth in an Unity. But if we contemn Saint <hi>Paul</hi>'s requeſt and exhortation, yet at the leaſt let us regard his earneſt entreating, in the which he doth very earneſtly charge us, and (as I may ſo ſpeak,) conjure us in this form and man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, <hi>If there be any Conſolation in Chriſt,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Phil. 2.</note> 
                        <hi>if there be any Comfort of Love, if you have any Fellowſhip of the Spirit, if you have any Bowels of Pity and Compaſſion, fulfil my Joy, being all like affected, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving one Charity, being of one Mind, of one Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, that nothing be done by Contention, or Vain-Glory.</hi> Who is he, that hath any Bowels of Pity, that will not be moved with theſe Words, ſo pithy? Whoſe Heart is ſo ſtony, that the Sword of theſe Words (which be more ſharp than any two edged Sword,) may not cut and break aſunder? Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore let us endeavour ourſelves to fulfil Saint <hi>Paul</hi>'s Joy here in this place, which ſhall be at length to our great Joy in another place.<note place="margin">How we ſhould read the Scripture.</note> Let us ſo read the Scripture, that by reading thereof, we may be made the better Liver<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>, rather than the more Contentious Diſputers. If any thing be neceſſary to be Taught, Reaſoned, or Diſputed, let us do it with all Meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, Softneſs, and Lenity. If any thing ſhall chance to be ſpoken uncomely, let one bear anothers Frail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. He, that is faulty, let him rather amend, than
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:54673:77"/> defend that which he hath ſpoken amiſs, leſt he fall by Contention from a fooliſh Errour into an obſtinate Hereſie. For it is better to give place meekly, than to win the Victory with the breach of Charity, which chanceth when every Man will defend his Opinion obſtinately. If we be the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Men, why do we not follow Chriſt, who ſaith,<note place="margin">Matth. 11.</note> 
                        <hi>Learn of me, for I am Meek, and Lowly in Heart?</hi> A Diſciple muſt learn the Leſſon of his Schoolmaſter, and a Servant muſt obey the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment of his Maſter,<note place="margin">James 3.</note> 
                        <hi>He that is Wiſe and Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,</hi> (ſaith Saint <hi>James,) let him ſhew his Goodneſs by his Good Converſation and Soberneſs of his Wiſdom. For where there is Envy and Contention, that Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom cometh not from God, but is wordly Wiſdom, Man's Wiſdom, and deviliſh Wiſdom.</hi> For the Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom that cometh from above, from the Spirit of God, is Chaſt and Pure, corrupted with no Evil Affections; it is Quiet, Meek, and Peaceable, ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horring all deſire of Contention; it is Tractable, Obedient, not Grudging to learn, and to give place to them that teach better for the Reformation. For there ſhall never be an end of Striving and Conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, if we contend, who in Contention ſhall be Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, and have the over-hand: We ſhall heap Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour upon Errour, if we continue to defend that obſtinately, which was ſpoken unadviſedly. For Truth it is, that Stiffneſs in maintaining an Opinion, breedeth Contention, Brawling, and Chiding, which is a Vice among all other moſt pernicious and peſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent to common Peace and Quietneſs. And as it ſtandeth betwixt two Perſons and Parties, (for no Man commonly doth chide with himſelf,) ſo it compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hendeth two moſt deteſtable Vices; the one is picking of Quarrels, with ſharp and contentious words; the other ſtandeth in froward anſwering, and multiplying evil Words again. The firſt is ſo abominable that Saint <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 5.</note> 
                        <hi>If any that is called a Brother, be a Worſhipper of Idols, a Brawler, a picker of Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rels, a Thief, or an Extortioner, with him that is
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:54673:77"/> ſuch a Man, ſee that you eat not.</hi> Now here con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider, that St. <hi>Paul</hi> numbreth a Scolder, a Brawler,<note place="margin">Againſt Quarrel-picking.</note> or a picker of Quarrels, among Thieves and Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, and many times there cometh leſs hurt of a Thief, than of a Railing Tongue: For the one taketh away a Man's good Name, the other taketh but his Riches, which is of much leſs Value and Eſtimation than is his good Name. And a Thief hurteth but him from whom he ſtealeth: But he that hath an evil Tongue, troubleth all the Town where he dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth, and ſomtime the whole Country. And a Rail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Tongue is a Peſtilence ſo full of Contagiouſneſs, that Saint <hi>Paul</hi> willeth Chriſtian Men to forbear the Company of ſuch,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 1.</note> and <hi>neither to eat nor drink with them.</hi> And whereas he will not, that a Chriſtian Woman ſhould forſake her Husband, although he be an Infidel, or that a Chriſtian Servant ſhould depart from his Maſter, which is an Infidel and Heathen, and ſo ſuffereth a Chriſtian Man to keep Company with an Infidel: Yet he forbiddeth us to eat or drink with a Scolder, or Quarrel-picker. And alſo in the Sixth Chapter to the Corinthians, he ſaith thus, <hi>Be not deceived, for neither Fornicators,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">1 Cor. 6.</note> 
                        <hi>neither Worſhippers of Idols, neither Thieves, nor Drunkards, nor curſed Speakers, ſhall dwell in the Kingdom of Heaven.</hi> It muſt needs be a great fault, that doth move and cauſe the Father to diſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herit his Natural Son. And how can it otherwiſe be,<note place="margin">Againſt froward anſwering.

Againſt the other Sin that ſtandeth in requiting Taunt for Taunt, ſpeaketh Chriſt, himſelf, ſaying, <hi>I ſay unto you, reſiſt not evil, but love your Enemies, and ſay well by them, that ſay evil by you, do well unto them that do evil unto you, and pray for them that do hurt and perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute you, that you may be the Children of your Father which is in Heaven, who ſuffereth his Sun to riſe both upon good and evil, and ſendeth his rain both
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:54673:78"/> upon the juſt and unjuſt.</hi> To this Doctrine of Chriſt agreeth very well the teaching of St. <hi>Paul,</hi> that choſen veſſel of God, who ceaſeth not to exhort and call up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on us,<note place="margin">Rom. 12.</note> ſaying, <hi>Bleſs them that curſe you, bleſs, I ſay, and curſe not, recompenſe to no man evil for evil, if it be poſſible (as much as lyeth in you,) live peaceably with all men.</hi>

                     <head>The Second Part of the Sermon againſt Contention.</head>
                     <p>IT hath been declared unto you in this Sermon a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Strife and Brawling, what great inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nience cometh thereby, ſpecially of ſuch Contenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on as groweth in matters of Religion: And how, when as no Man will give place to another, there is no end of contention and diſcord; and that unity, which God requireth of Chriſtians, is utterly thereby neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected and broken: And that this contention ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth chiefly in two points, as in picking of quarrels, and making of froward Anſwers. Now ye ſhall hear <hi>St. Paul</hi>'s words,<note place="margin">Rom. 12.</note> ſaying, <hi>Dearly beloved, avenge not yourſelves, but rather give place unto wrath, for it is written, Vengeance is mine, and I will revenge, ſaith the Lord. Therefore if thine enemy hunger, feed him, if he thirſt, give him drink; be not overcome with evil, but overcome evil with goodneſs.</hi> All theſe be the words of <hi>St. Paul,</hi> but they that be full of Stomach, and ſet ſo much by themſelves, that they may not abide ſo much as one evil word to be ſpoken of them, peradventure will ſay, If I be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viled,<note place="margin">An Obje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.</note> ſhall I ſtand ſtill like a Gooſe, or a Fool, with my Finger in my Mouth? Shall I be ſuch an Idiot and Dizard, to ſuffer every Man to ſpeak upon me what they liſt, to rail what they liſt, to ſpew out all
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:54673:78"/> their venom againſt me at their pleaſures? Is it not convenient, that he that ſpeaketh evil ſhould be anſwered accordingly? If I ſhall uſe this lenity and ſoftneſs, I ſhall both increaſe mine enemies froward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and provoke others to do the like. Such rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons make they, that can ſuffer nothing, for the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of their impatience. And yet,<note place="margin">An An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer.</note> if by froward anſwering to a froward perſon, there were hope to remedy his frowardneſs, he ſhould leſs offend that ſo ſhould anſwer, doing the ſame not of ire or ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice, but only of that intent, that he, that is ſo fro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward or malicious, may be reformed. But he that cannot amend another man's fault, or cannot amend it without his own fault, better it were that one ſhould periſh than two. Then if he cannot quiet him with gentle words, at the leaſt, let him not fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low him in wicked and uncharitable words. If he can pacifie him with ſuffering, let him ſuffer; and if not, it is better to ſuffer evil, than to do evil, to ſay well, than to ſay evil. For to ſpeak well againſt evil, cometh of the Spirit of God: But to render evil for evil, cometh of the contrary Spirit. And he that cannot temper, nor rule, his own anger, is but weak and feeble; and rather more like a Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man or a Child, than a ſtrong Man. For the true ſtrength and manlineſs is to overcome wrath, and to deſpiſe injuries, and other mens fooliſhneſs. And beſides this, he that ſhall deſpiſe the wrong done un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him by his enemy, every man ſhall perceive that it was ſpoken or done without cauſe: Whereas contrarily, he that doth fume and chafe at it, ſhall help the cauſe of his adverſary, giving ſuſpicion that the thing is true. And in ſo going about to revenge evil, we ſhew our ſelves to be evil; and while we puniſh and revenge another Man's folly, we double and augment our own folly. But many pretences find they that be wilful, to colour their impatience. Mine Enemy, ſay they, is not worthy to have gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle words or deeds, being ſo full of malice or fro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardneſs. Theleſs he is worthy, the more art thou
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:54673:79"/> therefore allowed of God, and the more art thou commended of Chriſt, for whoſe ſake thou ſhould<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt render good for evil, becauſe he hath command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed thee, and alſo deſerved that thou ſhouldeſt ſo do. Thy neighbor hath peradventure with a word of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended thee; call thou to thy remembrance, with how many words and deeds, how grievouſly thou haſt offended thy Lord God. What was Man, when Chriſt died for him? Was he not his enemy, and unworthy to have his Favour and Mercy? Even ſo, with what gentleneſs and patience doth he forbear, and tolerate, and ſuffer thee, although he is daily of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended by thee? Forgive therefore a light Treſpaſs to thy neighbour, that Chriſt may forgive thee ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thouſands of Treſpaſſes, which art every day an offender. For if thou forgive thy Brother, being to thee a treſpaſſer, then haſt thou a ſure ſign and token, that God will forgive thee, to whom all Men be debtors and treſpaſſers. How wouldſt thou have God merciful to thee, if thou wilt be cruel un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to thy Brother? Canſt thou not find in thy heart to do that towards another that is thy fellow, which God hath done to thee, that art but his ſervant? Ought not one ſinner to forgive another, ſeeing that Chriſt which was no ſinner, did pray to his Father for them that, without mercy, and deſpitefully put him to death?<note place="margin">1 Pet. 2.</note> 
                        <hi>Who, when he was reviled, he did not uſe reviling words again; and when he ſuffered wrongfully, he did not threaten, but gave all ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance to the judgment of his Father which judgeth rightfully.</hi> And what crackeſt thou of thy Head, if thou labour not to be in the Body? Thou canſt be no member of Chriſt, if thou follow not the ſteps of Chriſt:<note place="margin">Iſai. 53. Luke 23. Acts 7.</note> 
                        <hi>Who</hi> (as the Prophet ſaith,) <hi>was led to death like a Lamb, not opening his mouth to reviling,</hi> but opening his Mouth to praying for them that cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified him, ſaying, <hi>Father forgive them, for they cannot tell what they do.</hi> The which example, anon after Chriſt, <hi>St. Stephen</hi> did follow, and after, <hi>St. Paul: We be evil ſpoken of,</hi> (ſaith he,) <hi>and we ſpeak
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:54673:79"/> well: We ſuffer perſecution, and take it patiently: Men curſe us, and we gently intreat.</hi>
                        <note place="margin">1 Cor. 4.</note> Thus Saint <hi>Paul</hi> taught that he did, and he did that he taught. <hi>Bleſs you</hi> (ſaith he,) <hi>them that perſecute you; bleſs you, and curſe not.</hi> Is it a great thing to ſpeak well to thine Adverſary, to whom Chriſt doth command thee to do well? <hi>David,</hi> when <hi>Shimes</hi> did call him all to naught, did not chide again, but ſaid patiently, <hi>Suffer him to ſpeak evil, if perchance the Lord will have Mercy on me.</hi> Hiſtories be full of Examples of Heathen Men, that took very meekly both oppro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brious and reproachful Words, and injurious or wrongful Deeds. And ſhall thoſe Heathen excel in Patience us that profeſs Chriſt, the Teacher and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of all Patience? <hi>Lyſander,</hi> when one did rage againſt him, in reviling of him, he was nothing mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, but ſaid, Go to, go to, ſpeak againſt me as much, and as oft as thou wilt, and leave out no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, if perchance by this means thou mayſt diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge thee of thoſe naughty things, with the which it ſeemeth that thou art full laden. Many Men ſpeak evil of all Men, becauſe they can ſpeak well of no Man. After this ſort, this Wiſe Man avoideth from him the reproachful Words ſpoken unto him, imputing and laying them to the Natural Sickneſs of his Adverſary. <hi>Pericles,</hi> when a certain Scolder or railing Fellow did revile him, he anſwered not a word again, but went into a Gallery, and after, towards Night, when he went home, this Scolder followed him, raging ſtill more and more, becauſe he ſaw the other to ſet nothing by him: And after that he came to his Gate, (being dark Night,) <hi>Pericles</hi> commanded one of his Servants to light a Torch, and to bring the Scolder home to his own Houſe. He did not only with quiet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs ſuffer this Brawler patiently, but alſo recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſed an evil Turn with a good Turn, and that to his Enemy. Is it not a ſhame for us that profeſs Chriſt, to be worſe than Heathen People, in a thing chiefly pertaining to Chriſts Religion? Shall Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophy perſwade them, more than Gods Word ſhall
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:54673:80"/> perſwade us? Shall Natural Reaſon prevail more with them, than Religion ſhall with us? Shall Mans Wiſdom lead them to thoſe things, whereunto the Heavenly Doctrine cannot lead us? What blindneſs, wilfulneſs, or rather madneſs is this? <hi>Pericles,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing provoked to anger with many villanous words, anſwered not a word: But we, ſtirred but with one little word, what foul work do we make? How do we fume, rage, ſtamp, and ſtare like Mad Men? Many Men, of every trifle will make a great mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and of a ſpark, of a little word, will kindle a great fire, taking all things in the worſt part. But how much better is it,<note place="margin">Reaſons to move Men from quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel-pick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</note> and more like to the Example and Doctrine of Chriſt, to make rather a greater fault, in our Neighbour, a ſmall fault, reaſoning with our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves after this ſort; He ſpake theſe words, but it was in a ſudden heat; or the Drink ſpake them, and not he; or he ſpake them at the motion of ſome other; or he ſpake them being ignorant of the truth, he ſpake them not againſt me, but againſt him whom he thought me to be. But as touching evil ſpeaking, he that is ready to ſpeak evil againſt other Men, firſt let him examine himſelf, whether he be faultleſs and clear of the fault which he findeth in another. For it is a ſhame when he that blameth another for any fault, is guilty himſelf, either in the ſame fault, or in a greater. It is a ſhame for him that is blind to call another Man blind, and it is more ſhame for him that is whole blind to call him blinkard that is but purblind: For this is to ſee a ſtraw in another Mans Eye, when a Man hath a block in his own Eye.</p>
                     <p>Then let him conſider, that he that uſeth to ſpeak evil ſhall commonly be evil ſpoken of again. And he that ſpeaketh what he will for his pleaſure, ſhall be compelled to hear what he would not, to his diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſure. Moreover, let him remember that ſaying, <hi>That we ſhall give an account for every idle Word.</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Mat. 12.</note> How much more then ſhall we make reckoning for our ſharp, bitter, brawling and chiding Words, which provoke our Brother to be angry, and ſo to the
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:54673:80"/> breach of his Charity? And as touching evil an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwering, although we be never ſo much provoked by other Mens evil ſpeaking, yet we ſhall not follow their frowardneſs by evil anſwering, if we conſider, that anger is a kind of madneſs, and that he which is an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry, is (as it were for the time;) in a phrenſie. Wherefore let him beware,<note place="margin">Reaſons to move Men from fro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwering.</note> leſt in his fury he ſpeak any thing, whereof afterward he may have juſt cauſe to be ſorry. And he that will defend, that anger is not fury, but that he hath reaſon, even when he is moſt angry; then let him reaſon thus with himſelf, when he is angry; Now I am ſo moved and chafed, that within a little while after I ſhall be otherwiſe minded; wherefore then ſhould I now ſpeak any thing in mine anger, which hereafter, when I would faineſt, cannot be changed? Wherefore ſhall I do any thing, now, being (as it were,) out of my Wit, for the which, when I ſhall come to my ſelf again, I ſhall be very ſad? Why doth not Reaſon, why doth not Godlineſs, yea, why doth not Chriſt obtain that thing now of me, which hereafter Time ſhall obtain of me? If a Man be called an Adulterer, Uſurer, Drunkard, or by any other ſhameful Name, let him conſider earneſtly, whether he be ſo called tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly or falſly; if truly, let him amend his fault, that his Adverſary may not after worthily charge him with ſuch Offences: If theſe things be laid againſt him falſly, yet let him conſider, whether he hath given any occaſion to be ſuſpected of ſuch things, and ſo he may both cut off that ſuſpicion, whereof this ſlander did ariſe, and in other things ſhall live more warily. And thus uſing ourſelves, we may take no hurt, but rather much good, by the rebukes and ſlanders of our Enemy. For the reproach of an Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my may be to many men a quicker ſpur to the amendment of their life, than the gentle monition of a Friend. <hi>Philippus</hi> the King of <hi>Macedonia,</hi> when he was evil ſpoken of by the chief Rulers of the City of <hi>Athens,</hi> he did thank them heartily, becauſe by them he was made better, both in his Words and
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:54673:81"/> Deeds: For I ſtudy (ſaith he,) both by my Sayings and Doings to prove them Lyars.</p>

Now to proceed in the ſame matter, you ſhall know the right way how to diſprove and overcome your Adverſary and Enemy. This is the beſt way to diſprove a Man's Adverſary, ſo to live, that all which ſhall know his Honeſty, may bear witneſs that he is ſlandered un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthily. If the fault, whereof he is ſlandered, be ſuch, that for the defence of his Honeſty, he muſt needs make anſwer, let him anſwer quietly and ſoft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, on this faſhion, That thoſe faults be laid againſt him falſly.

                        <note place="margin">Phil. 3.</note> And his Zeal is godly, and to be allowed, as it is plainly proved by the example of Chriſt, who although he were the Fountain and Spring of all Meekneſs, Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleneſs and Softneſs,<note place="margin">Matth. 23.</note> yet he called the obſtinate Scribes and Phariſees, <hi>Blind Guides, Fools, painted Graves, Hypocrites, Serpents, Adders brood, a corrupt and wicked Generation.</hi> Alſo he rebuketh <hi>Peter</hi> eager<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, ſaying, <hi>Go behind me, Satan.</hi>

And they be unworthy to live in a Commonwealth, the which do as much as lieth in them, with Brawling and Scolding, to diſturb the Quietneſs and Peace of the ſame.

<pb n="151" facs="tcp:54673:82"/> Tongues. If we have forſaken the Devil, let us uſe no more Deviliſh Tongues: He that hath been a rail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Scolder, now let him be a ſober Counſellor. He that hath been a malicious Slanderer, now let him be a loving Comforter. He that hath been a vain Railer, now let him be a ghoſtly Teacher. He that hath abuſed his Tongue in Curſing, now let him uſe it in Bleſſing. He that hath abuſed his Tongue in evil-ſpeaking, now let him uſe it in ſpeaking well. All Bitterneſs, Anger, Railing and Blaſphemy, let it be avoided from you. If you may, and if it be poſſible, in no wiſe be angry. But if you may not be clean void of this paſſion, yet then ſo temper and bridle it, that it ſtir you not to Contention and Brawl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. If you be provoked with evil-ſpeaking, arm yourſelf with Patience, Lenity, and Silence, either ſpeaking nothing, or elſe being very ſoft, meek, and gentle in anſwering. Overcome thine Adverſary with Benefits and Gentleneſs. And above all things, keep Peace and Unity: Be no Peace-breakers, but Peace-makers. And then there is no doubt, but that God, the Author of Comfort and Peace, will grant us Peace of Conſcience, and ſuch Concord and Agreement, that with one Mouth and Mind, we may glorifie God the Father of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, to whom be all Glory, now and for ever. <hi>AMEN.</hi>

                     <p>WHereas there appeareth in theſe days great ſlackneſs and negligence of a great ſort of People, in reſorting to the Church, there to ſerve God their Heavenly Father, according to their moſt bounden duty, as alſo much Uncomely and Unreverent behaviour of many Perſons in the ſame when they be there aſſembled, and thereby may juſt fear ariſe of the Wrath of God, and his dreadful Plagues hanging over Head for our grievous Offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces in this behalf, amongſt other many and great Sins which we daily and hourly commit before the Lord. Therefore for the diſcharge of all our Conſciences, and for the avoiding of the common Peril and Plague hanging over us, let us conſider what may be ſaid out of Gods Holy Book concerning this matter, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto I pray you give good Audience, for that it is of great weight, and concerneth you all. Although the Eternal and Incomprehenſible Majeſty of God, the Lord of Heaven and Earth, whoſe ſeat is Heaven, and the Earth his Footſtool, cannot be incloſed in Temples or Houſes made with Mans Hand, as in dwelling places able to receive or contain his Majeſty,
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:54673:87" rendition="simple:additions"/> according as is evidently declared by the Prophet <hi>I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaiah,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Iſaiah 66. Act. 7.17. 3 Reg. 8. 2 Par. 2. and 6.</note> and by the Doctrine of St. <hi>Stephen,</hi> and St. <hi>Paul</hi> in the Acts of the Apoſtles. And where King <hi>Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi> (who builded unto the Lord the moſt glorious Temple that ever was made,) ſaith, <hi>Who ſhall be able to build a meet or worthy Houſe for him? If Heaven, and the Heaven above all Heavens cannot contain him, how much leſs can that which I have builded?</hi> And further confeſſeth; <hi>What am I that I ſhould be able to build thee an Houſe, O Lord? But yet for this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe only it is made, that thou mayeſt regard the Prayer of thy Servant, and his Humble Supplication.</hi> Much leſs then be our Churches meet dwelling places to receive the Incomprehenſible Majeſty of God. And indeed, the chief and ſpecial Temples of God, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in he hath greateſt pleaſure, and moſt delighteth to dwell and continue in, are the Bodies and Minds of true Chriſtians, and the choſen People of God, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Doctrine of the Holy Scripture, decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in the Firſt Epiſtle to the <hi>Corinthians.

For the Temple of God is Holy, which ye are.</hi> And again in the ſame Epiſtle: <hi>Know ye not that your body is the Temple of the Holy Ghoſt dwelling in you, whom ye have given you of God,</hi>

All which things are evident to be proved by God's Holy Word, as hereafter ſhall plainly appear.</p>
                     <p>And firſt of all, I will declare by the Scriptures, that it is called, (as it is indeed,) the Houſe of God, and Temple of the Lord. <hi>He that Sweareth by the Temple,</hi> (ſaith our Saviour Chriſt,<note place="margin">John 2.

                     <p>In the Story of the <hi>Acts</hi> of the Apoſtles,<note place="margin">Acts 13.</note> we read that <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas</hi> Preached the Word of God in the Temples of the Jews at <hi>Salamine.</hi> And when they came to <hi>Antiochia, they entred on the Sabbath-day into the Synagogue or Church, and ſate down, and after the Leſſon or Reading of the Law and the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, the Ruler of the Temple ſent unto them, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; Ye Men and Brethren, if any of you have any Exhortation to make unto the People, ſay it.

                     <p>It is written in the Stories of the Goſpel in divers places, that <hi>Jeſus went round about all</hi> Galilee,<note place="margin">Matth. 4. Mark 1. Luke 4. Matth. 13.20. Mark 6. Luke 13. Luke 4.</note>

                     <p>Here ye ſee as well the diligence of our Saviour in teaching the Word of God in the Temple daily, and ſpecially on the Sabbath-days, as alſo the readineſs of the People reſorting all together, and that early in the Morning, into the Temple to hear him.</p>
                     <p>The ſame Example of diligence in preaching the Word of God in the Temple, ſhall ye find in the Apoſtles, and the People reſorting unto them, <hi>Acts</hi> the Fifth. Where the Apoſtles, although they had been whipped and ſcourged the day before, and by the High Prieſt commanded that they ſhould preach no more in the Name of Jeſus, yet the day following they entred early in the Morning into the Temple, and did not ceaſe to teach and declare Jeſus Chriſt. And in ſundry other places of the Story of the <hi>Acts,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Acts 13.15.17.</note> ye ſhall find like diligence both in the Apoſtles in Teaching, and in the People in coming to the Temple to hear Gods Word. And it is teſtified in the Firſt of <hi>Luke, that when</hi> Zachary <hi>the Holy Prieſt,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Luke 1.</note> and Father to <hi>John Baptiſt, did Sacrifice within the Temple, all the People ſtood without a long time praying,</hi> ſuch was their zeal and fervency at that time. And in the Second of <hi>Luke</hi> appeareth what great Journeys Men,<note place="margin">Luke 2.</note> Women, yea, and Children took, to come to the Temple on the Feaſt-day, there to ſerve the
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:54673:89"/> Lord, and ſpecially the Example of <hi>Joſeph,</hi> the Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> Mother to our Saviour Jeſus Chriſt, and of our Saviour Chriſt himſelf, being yet but a Child, whoſe Examples are worthy for us to follow. So that if we would compare our negligence in reſorting to the Houſe of the Lord, there to ſerve him, with the dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence of the Jews, in coming daily very early, ſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times by great Journeys to their Temple, and when the multitude could not be received within the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, the fervent zeal that they had, was declared in ſtanding long without and Praying: We may juſtly in this Compariſon condemn our ſlothfulneſs and neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence, yea, plain contempt, in coming to the Lord's Houſe, ſtanding ſo near unto us, ſo ſeldom, and ſcarcely at any time.</p>
                     <p>So far is it from a great many of us to come early in the Morning, or give attendance without, who diſdain to come into the Temple: And yet we abhor the very Name of the Jews when we hear it, as of a moſt wicked and ungodly People.</p>
                     <p>But it is to be feared, that in this point we be far worſe than the Jews, and that they ſhall riſe at the day of Judgment, to our Condemnation, who in Compariſon to them, ſhew ſuch ſlackneſs and contempt in reſorting to the Houſe of the Lord, there to ſerve him, according as we are of duty moſt bound.</p>
                     <p>And beſides this moſt horrible dread of God's juſt Judgment in the great day, we ſhall not in this Life eſcape his heavy Hand and Vengeance for this contempt of the Houſe of the Lord, and his due ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice in the ſame, according as the Lord himſelf threatneth in the Firſt Chapter of the Prophet <hi>Ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geus,</hi> after this ſort:<note place="margin">Agge 1.</note>

                     <p>In the Second of <hi>Luke</hi> it is written, how that <hi>the mother of Chriſt and Joſeph,</hi> when they had long ſought Chriſt, whom they had loſt, and could find him no where,<note place="margin">Luke 2.</note> that at the laſt, <hi>they found him in the Temple, ſitting in the midſt of the Doctors,</hi> So if we lack Jeſus Chriſt, that is to ſay, the Saviour of our Souls and Bodies, we ſhall not find him in the Market-place, or in the Guild-Hall, much leſs in the Ale-houſe or Tavern, amongſt good Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows, (as they call them,) ſo ſoon as we ſhall find him in the Temple, the Lords Houſe, amongſt the Teachers, and Preachers of his Word, where indeed he is to be found.

It is written of all the four Evangeliſts, as a Notable Act,<note place="margin">Matth. 21. Mar. 11. Luke 19. John 11.</note> and worthy to be teſtified by many Holy Witneſſes, how that our Saviour Jeſus Chriſt, that Merciful and Mild Lord, compared for his Meekneſs to a Sheep, ſuffering with ſilence his Fleece to be ſhorn from him,<note place="margin">Iſaiah 53.

<pb n="172" facs="tcp:54673:93" rendition="simple:additions"/> them that did reproach him and ſpit upon him, and, according to his own Example, gave Precepts of Mildneſs and Sufferance to his Diſciples: Yet when he ſeeth the Temple and Holy Houſe of his Heavenly Father miſordered, polluted, and prophaned, uſeth great ſeverity and ſharpneſs, overturneth the Tables of the Exchangers, ſubverted the Seats of them that ſold Doves, maketh a whip of Cords, and ſcourgeth out thoſe wicked abuſers and profaners of the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of God, ſaying, <hi>My Houſe ſhall be called the Houſe of Prayer, but ye have made it a Den of Thieves.</hi>
                        <note place="margin">John 2.</note> And in the Second of <hi>John, Do not ye make the Houſe of my Father, the Houſe of Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chandize?</hi> For as it is the Houſe of God, when Gods ſervice is duly done in it: So when we wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly abuſe it with wicked talk, or covetous bargain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, we make it a Den of Thieves, or an Houſe of Merchandize.<note place="margin">Mark 11</note> Yea, and ſuch Reverence would Chriſt ſhould be therein, that he would not ſuffer any Veſſel to be carried through the Temple. And whereas our Saviour Chriſt (as is before mentioned out of Saint <hi>Luke,</hi>) could be found no where (when he was ſought,) but only in the Temple amongſt the Doctors, and now again he exerciſeth his Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority and Juriſdiction, not in Caſtles and Princely Palaces, amongſt Souldiers, but in the Temple: Ye may hereby underſtand, in what place his ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Kingdom (which he denieth to be of this World,) is ſooneſt to be found, and beſt to be known of all places in this World. And according to this Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of our Saviour Chriſt in the Primitive Church, which was moſt Holy and Godly, and in the which due diſcipline with ſeverity was uſed againſt the wicked, open Offenders were not ſuffered once to enter into the Houſe of the Lord, nor admitted to Common Prayer, and the uſe of the Holy Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments with other true Chriſtians, until they had done open Penance before the whole Church. And this was practiſed, not only upon mean Perſons, but alſo upon the Rich, Noble, and Mighty Perſons;
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:54673:93" rendition="simple:additions"/> yea, upon <hi>Theodoſius,</hi> that Puiſſant and Mighty Emperor, whom, for committing<note n="*" place="margin">The Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples fault was moſt grievous: The ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted otherwiſe and more cruel than it ſhould.</note> a grievous and wilful Murder, Saint <hi>Ambroſe</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Milain</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved ſharply, and ‡ did alſo Excommunicate the ſaid Emperor, and brought him to open Penance. And they, that were ſo juſtly exempted and baniſhed (as it were,) from the Houſe of the Lord, were taken (as they be indeed,) for Men divided and ſeparated from Chriſts Church, and in moſt dangerous eſtate, yea, as Saint <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith,<note n="*" place="margin">1 Cor. 5</note>

And yet we willingly, either by abſenting ourſelves from the Houſe of the Lord, do (as it were,) Excommunicate ourſelves from the Church and and Fellowſhip of the Saints of God, or elſe coming thither, by uncomely and unreverent behaviour there, by haſty, raſh, yea, unclean and wicked Thoughts and Words before the Lord our God, horribly diſhonour his Holy Houſe the Church of God, and his Holy Name and Majeſty, to the great danger of our Souls, yea, and certain Damnation al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo, if we do not ſpeedily and earneſtly Repent us of this Wickedneſs.</p>
                     <p>Thus ye have heard (dearly beloved,) out of Gods Word, what Reverence is due to the Holy Houſe of the Lord, how all Godly Perſons ought with di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence at times appointed thither to repair, how they ought to behave themſelves there, with Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence and Dread before the Lord, what Plagues and Puniſhments, as well Temporal as Eternal, the Lord in his Holy Word threatneth, as well to ſuch as neglect to come to his Holy Houſe, as alſo to
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:54673:94" rendition="simple:additions"/> ſuch, who coming thither, do unreverently by ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture or talk there behave themſelves. Wherefore if we deſire to have ſeaſonable Weather, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by to enjoy the good Fruits of the Earth, if we will avoid Drought and Barrenneſs, Thirſt and Hunger, which are Plagues threatned unto ſuch as make haſte to go to their own Houſes, to Ale-Houſes and Taverns, and leave the Houſe of the Lord empty and deſolate, if we abhor to be ſcour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, not with Whips made of Cords, out of the material Temple only (as our Saviour Chriſt ſerved the Deſilers of the Houſe of God in <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi>) but alſo to be beaten and driven out of the Eternal Temple and Houſe of the Lord (which is his Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Kingdom,<note place="margin">Epheſ. 3.</note>) with the Iron Rod of Everlaſting Damnation, and caſt into utter Darkneſs, where is Weeping and Gnaſhing of Teeth, if we Fear, Dread, and abhor this, (I ſay,) as we have moſt juſt cauſe to do: Then let us amend this our negligence and contempt in coming to the Houſe of the Lord, this our unreverent behaviour in the Houſe of the Lord, and reſorting thither diligently together, let us there with Reverent hearing of the Lords Holy Word, cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling on the Lords Holy Name, giving of hearty Thanks unto the Lord for his manifold and ineſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mable benefits daily and hourly beſtowed upon us, celebrating alſo Reverently the Lords Holy Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, ſerve the Lord in his Holy Houſe, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cometh the Servants of the Lord, in Holineſs and Righteouſneſs before him all the days of our Life; and then we ſhall be aſſured, after this Life, to reſt in his Holy Hill, and to dwell in his Tabernacle, there to Praiſe and Magnifie his Holy Name in the Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation of his Saints, in the Holy Houſe of his Eternal Kingdom of Heaven, which he hath purchaſed for us, by the Death and Shedding of the precious Blood of his Son, our Saviour Jeſus Chriſt, to whom with the Father, and the Holy Ghoſt, one Immortal God, be all Honour, Glory, Praiſe, and Thankſgiving, world without end. <hi>Amen.</hi>

                     <p>IN what points the true Ornaments of the Church or Temple of God do conſiſt and ſtand, hath been declared in the two laſt Homilies, treating of the Right Uſe of the Temple or Houſe of God, and of the due Reverence that all true Chriſtian Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple are bound to give unto the ſame. The Sum whereof is, that the Church or Houſe of God is a place appointed by the Holy Scriptures, where the lively Word of God ought to be Read, Taught, and Heard, the Lords Holy Name called upon by publick Prayer, hearty Thanks given to his Majeſty for his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite and unſpeakable benefits beſtowed upon us, his Holy Sacraments duly and reverently miniſtred, and that therefore all that be Godly indeed, ought both with diligence at times appointed, to repair together to the ſaid Church, and there with all Reverence to uſe
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:54673:95"/> and behave themſelves before the Lord. And that the ſaid Church thus godly uſed by the Servants of the Lord, in the Lords true Service, for the effectual preſence of Gods Grace, wherewith he doth by his holy Word and Promiſes endue his people there pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent and aſſembled, to the attainment as well of Commodities worldly, neceſſary for us, as alſo of all heavenly Gifts, and Life everlaſting, is called by the Word of God (as it is indeed,) the Temple of the Lord, and the Houſe of God, and that therefore the due Reverence thereof is ſtirred up in the Hearts of the Godly, by the Conſideration of theſe true Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naments of the ſaid Houſe of God, and not by any outward Ceremonies, or coſtly and glorious decking of the ſaid Houſe, or Temple of the Lord, contrary to the which moſt manifeſt Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of the Scriptures, and contrary to the uſage of the Primitive Chruch, which was pure and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corrupt, and contrary to the Sentences and Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the moſt antient, learned and godly Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors of the Church, (as hereafter ſhall appear,) the Corruption of theſe later days hath brought in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Church infinite multitudes of Images, and the ſame, with other parts of the Temple alſo, have decked with Gold and Silver, painted with Colours, ſet them with Stone and Pearl, clothed them with Silks and precious Veſtures, fancying untruly that to be the chief Decking and Adorning of the Temple or the Houſe of God, and that all People ſhould be the more moved to the due Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence of the ſame, if all Corners thereof were glorious, and gliſtering with Gold and precious Stones. Whereas indeed, they, by the ſaid Images, and ſuch Glorious decking of the Temple, have nothing at all profited ſuch as were Wiſe and Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding: But have thereby greatly hurt the Simple and Unwiſe, occaſioning them thereby to commit horrible Idolatry. And the covetous Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, by the ſame occaſion, ſeeming to worſhip, and peradventure worſhipping indeed, not only the
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:54673:95"/> Images, but alſo the matter of them, Gold and Silver, as that Vice is of all others in the Scriptures peculiarly called <hi>Idolatry,</hi>

                        <hi>or worſhipping of Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges.</hi> Againſt the which foul Abuſes and great Enor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities ſhall be alledged unto you: Firſt, the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of Gods holy Word, as well out of the Old Teſtament, as of the New. And ſecondly, the Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies of the holy and ancient learned Fathers and Doctors, out of their own Works and ancient Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtories Eccleſiaſtical, both that you may at once know their Judgments, and withal underſtand what man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of Ornaments were in the Temples in the Primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Church, in thoſe times which were moſt pure and ſincere. Thirdly, the Reaſons and Arguments made for the defence of Images or Idols, and the outragious decking of Temples and Churches, with Gold, Silver, Pearl, and precious Stones, ſhall be confuted, and ſo this whole matter concluded. But leſt any ſhould take occaſion by the way, of doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by Words or Names, it is thought good here to note firſt of all, that although in common ſpeech we uſe to call the likeneſs or ſimilitudes of Men or other things, Images, and not Idols; yet the Scriptures uſe the ſaid two words (<hi>Idols</hi> and <hi>Images,</hi>) indifferently for one thing alway. They be words of divers Tongues and Sounds, but one in Senſe and Significa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in the Scriptures. The one is taken of the Greek word <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, an Idol, and the other of the Latin word <hi>Imago,</hi> an Image, and ſo both uſed as Engliſh terms in the tranſlating of Scriptures indifferently, according as the <hi>Septuaginta</hi> have in their Tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in Greek <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, and Saint <hi>Jerome</hi> in his Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlation of the ſame places in Latin hath <hi>Simulachra,</hi> in Engliſh, <hi>Images.</hi> And in the New Teſtament,<note place="margin">1 John 5<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

                        </gap>, Saint <hi>Jerome</hi> likewiſe tranſlateth <hi>Simulachrum,</hi> as in all other like places of Scripture uſually he doth ſo tranſlate. And <hi>Tertullian,</hi> a moſt ancient Doctor, and well learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in both the Tongues, Greek and Latin, inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preting this place of Saint <hi>John, Beware of Idols,</hi>
                        <pb n="178" facs="tcp:54673:96"/> that is to ſay,<note place="margin">Lib. de corona militis.</note> (ſaith <hi>Tertullian,</hi>) of the Images them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves: The Latin words which he uſeth, be <hi>Effigies</hi> and <hi>Imago,</hi> that is to ſay, an Image. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it skilleth not, whether in this proceſs we uſe the one term or the other, or both together, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing they both (though not in common Engliſh Speech, yet in Scripture,) ſignifie one thing. And though ſome, to blind Mens Eyes, have heretofore craftily gone about to make them to be taken for words of divers Significations in Matters of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and have therefore uſually named the likeneſs or ſimilitude of a thing ſet up amongſt the Heathen in their Temples, or other places to be worſhipped, an Idol.</p>
                     <p>But the like ſimilitude with us, ſet up in the Church, the place of Worſhipping, they call an I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage, as though theſe two words (<hi>Idol</hi> and <hi>Image,</hi>) in Scripture, did differ in property and ſenſe, which (as is aforeſaid,) differ only in Sound and Language, and in meaning be indeed all one, eſpecially in the Scriptures and matters of Religion. And our Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges alſo have been, and be, and, if they be pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickly ſuffered in Churches and Temples, ever will be alſo worſhipped, and ſo Idolatry committed to them, as in the laſt part of this Homily ſhall at large be declared and proved. Wherefore our Images in Temples and Churches be indeed none other but Idols, as unto the which Idolatry hath been, is, and ever will be committed.</p>
                     <p>And firſt of all, the Scriptures of the Old Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament, condemning and abhorring as well all I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dolatry or worſhipping of Images, as alſo the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Idols or Images themſelves, eſpecially in Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, are ſo many and plentiful, that it were al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt an infinite Work, and to be contained in no ſmall Volume, to record all the places concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ſame. For when God had choſen to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf a peculiar and ſpecial People from amongſt all other Nations that knew not God, but worſhipped
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:54673:96"/> Idols and falſe Gods, he gave unto them certain Ordinances and Laws to be kept and obſerved of his ſaid People. But concerning none other mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter did he give either more, or more earneſt and expreſs Laws to his ſaid People, than thoſe that concerned the true Worſhipping of him, and the avoiding and fleeing of Idols, and Images, and Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry: For that, both the ſaid Idolatry is moſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugnant to the right worſhipping of him, and his true Glory, above all other Vices; and that he knew the proneneſs and inclination of Mans corrupt Kind and Nature, to that moſt odious and abominable Vice. Of the which the Ordinances and Laws, ſo gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven by the Lord to his People concerning this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, I will rehearſe and alledge ſome that be moſt ſpecial for this purpoſe, that you, by them, may judge of the reſt.</p>
                     <p>In the fourth Chapter of the Book named <hi>Deu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teronomy,</hi> is a notable place,<note place="margin">Deut. 4. Numb. 22.</note> and moſt worthy with all diligence to be marked, which beginneth thus:</p>

                     <p>And by and by after he repeateth the ſame Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence three or four times, before he come to the matter that he would ſpecially warn them of, as it were for a Preface, to make them to take the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter heed unto it.</p>

                     </p>
                     <p>And again, <hi>Beware that thou forget not the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of the Lord thy God, which he made with thee, and ſo make to thy ſelf any carved Image of them which the Lord hath forbidden to be made: For the Lord thy God is a conſuming Fire, and a jealous God. If you have Children and Nephews, and do tarry in the Land, and being deceived do make to your ſelves any ſimilitude, doing evil before the Lord your God, and provoke him to anger: I do this day call upon Heaven and Earth to witneſs, that ye ſhall quickly periſh out of the Land which you ſhall poſſeſs, you ſhall not dwell in it any long time, but the Lord will deſtroy you, and will ſcatter you amongſt all Nations, and ye ſhall remain but a very few amongſt the Nations, whither the Lord will lead you away, and then ſhall you ſerve Gods which are made with Mans Hands, of Wood and Stone, which ſee not, and hear not, neither eat nor ſmell,</hi> and ſo forth.</p>

                     <p>This is a notable Chapter, and treateth almoſt altogether of this matter. But becauſe it is too long to write out the whole, I have noted you certain principal points out of it.</p>

                     <p>And when they, this notwithſtanding, partly by Inclination of Mans corrupt Nature, moſt prone to Idolatry, and partly occaſioned by the Gentiles and Heathen People dwelling about them, who were Idolaters, did fall to the making and worſhipping of Images; God, according to his Word, brought up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them all thoſe Plagues which he threatned them with, as appeareth in the Books of the <hi>Kings</hi> and the <hi>Chronicles,</hi> in ſundry places at large. And agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able hereunto are many other notable places in the Old Teſtament, <hi>Deuteronomy</hi> 27. <hi>Curſed be he that maketh a carved Image, or a caſt or molten Image, which is abomination before the Lord, the Work of the Artificers Hand, and ſetteth it up in a ſecret corner; and all the People ſhall ſay, Amen.</hi>

                     <p>Read the thirteeenth and fourteenth Chapters of the Book of <hi>Wiſdom,</hi> concerning Idols or Images, how they be made, ſet up, called upon, and offered unto, and how he praiſeth the Tree whereof the Gib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bet is made, as happy, in compariſon to the Tree that an Image or Idol is made of, even by theſe ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry words, Happy is the Tree where through Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs cometh, (meaning the Gibbet,) but cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed is the Idol that is made with hands, yea, both it, and he that made it, and ſo forth. And by and by he ſheweth, how that the things which were the good Creatures of God before, (as Trees or Stones,) when they be once altered and faſhioned into Images to be worſhipped, become abomination, a temptation unto the Souls of Men, and a ſnare for the feet of the unwiſe. And why? The ſeeking out of Images is the beginning of Whoredom, ſaith he, (and the bringing up of them, is the deſtruction of Life: For they were not from the beginning, neither ſhall they continue for ever. The wealthy idleneſs of Men hath found them out upon Earth, therefore ſhall they come ſhortly to an end: And ſo forth to the end of the Chapter, containing theſe Points, How Idols or Images were firſt invented, and offered unto, how by an ungracious cuſtom they were eſtabliſhed, how Tyrants compel Men to worſhip them, how the ignorant and the common People are deceived by the cunning of the Work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, and the beauty of the Image, to do honour unto it, and to err from the knowledg of God, and of other great and many Miſchiefs, that come hy Images. And for a concluſion, he ſaith, That the honouring of abominable Images is the cauſe, the beginning, and end, of all evil, and that the Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhippers of them be either mad, or moſt wicked. See and view the whole Chapter with diligence, for it is worthy to be well conſidered, ſpecially that is written of the deceiving of the ſimple and unwiſe common People by Idols and Images, and repeated twice or thrice,<note place="margin">Sap. 15.</note> leſt it ſhould be forgotten. And in

                        <note place="margin">Places of the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture againſt Idols or Images.</note> 
                        <hi>Ezekiel</hi> and <hi>Baruch,</hi> eſpecially in theſe places and Chapters of them: <hi>Pſalm</hi> 115. and 134. <hi>Iſaiah</hi> 40. and 44. <hi>Ezekiel</hi> the 6th. <hi>Wiſdom</hi> 13, 14.15. <hi>Baruch</hi> 6. The which places, as I exhort you often and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligently to read, ſo are they too long at this preſent to be rehearſed in an Homily. Notwithſtanding, I will make you certain brief or ſhort Notes out of them, what they ſay of theſe Idols or Images. Firſt, that they be made but of ſmall pieces of Wood, Stone, or Metal, and therefore they cannot be any ſimilitudes of the great Majeſty of God, whoſe Seat is Heaven, and the Earth his Footſtool. Secondly, that they be dead, have Eyes, and ſee not, Hands, and feel not, Feet, and cannot go, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and therefore they cannot be fit Similitudes of the living God. Thirdly, that they have no power to do good nor harm to others, though ſome of them have an Ax, ſome a Sword, ſome a Spear in their hands; yet do Thieves come into their Temples and rob them, and they cannot once ſtir to defend themſelves from the Thieves: Nay, if the Temple or Church be ſet a fire, that their Prieſts can run away and ſave themſelves, but they cannot once move, but tarry ſtill like blocks as they are, and be burned, and therefore they can be no meet Figures of the Puiſſant and Mighty God, who alone is able both to ſave his Servants, and to deſtroy his Enemies everlaſtingly. They be trim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly deckt in Gold, Silver, and Stone, as well the Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of Men as of Women, like wanton wenches (ſaith the Prophet <hi>Baruch,</hi>) that love Paramours,<note place="margin">Baruch 6.</note> and therefore can they not teach us, nor our Wives and Daughters any Soberneſs, Modeſty, and Chaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:54673:100" rendition="simple:additions"/> And therefore although it is now commonly ſaid, that they be the Lay-mens Books, yet we ſee they teach no good Leſſon, neither of God, nor Godlineſs, but all Error and Wickedneſs. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God by his Word, as he fordiddeth any Idols or Images to be made or ſet up, ſo doth he command ſuch as we find made and ſet up to be pulled down, broken, and deſtroyed.</p>
                     <p>
                        <note place="margin">Numb. 23.</note>And it is written in the Book of <hi>Numbers,</hi> the 23 Chapter, that <hi>there was no Idol in Jacob, nor there was no Image ſeen in Iſrael, and that the Lord God was with the People.</hi> Where note, that the true Iſraelites, that is, the People of God, have no Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges among them, but that God was with them, and that therefore their Enemies cannot hurt them, as appeareth in the Proceſs of that Chapter. And as concerning Images already ſet up, thus ſaith the Lord in <hi>Deuteronomy:</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Deut. 7. and 12.</note> 
                        <hi>Overturn their Altars, and break them to pieces, cut down their Groves, burn their Images; for thou art an holy People unto the Lord.</hi> And the ſame is repeated more vehemently again in the twelfth Chapter of the ſame Book. Here note, what the People of God ought to do to Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, where they find them. But leſt any private per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, upon colour of deſtroying Images, ſhould make any ſtir or diſturbance in the Commonwealth, it muſt always be remembred, that the redreſs of ſuch publick Enormities pertaineth to the Magiſtrates, and ſuch as be in Authority only, and not to private Perſons; and therefore the good Kings of <hi>Juda, Aſa, Ezechias, Joſaphat,</hi> and <hi>Joſias,</hi> are highly commend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for the breaking down and deſtroying of the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tars, Idols, and Images. And the Scriptures de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare, that they, ſpecially in that point, did that which was right before the Lord. And contrari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe,<note place="margin">1 Kings 16. 2 Chron. 14.15.31</note> 
                        <hi>Jeroboam, Achab, Joas,</hi> and other Princes, which either ſet up, or ſuffered ſuch Altars or Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges undeſtroyed, are by the word of God reported to have done evil before the Lord.

And how he will handle, puniſh, and deſtroy the People that ſo ſet up, or ſuffer ſuch Altars, Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, or Idols undeſtroyed, he denounceth by his Prophet <hi>Ezekiel</hi> on this manner: <hi>I my ſelf</hi> (ſaith the Lord,) <hi>will bring a ſword over you,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Numb. 1. Ezekiel 6.</note>

So that if either the multitude, or plainneſs of the places might make us to underſtand, or the earneſt charge that God giveth in the ſaid pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces move us to regard, or the horrible plagues, pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhments, and dreadful deſtruction, threatned to ſuch worſhippers of Images or Idols, ſetters up, or maintainers of them, might engender any fear in our Hearts, we would once leave and forſake this wickedneſs, being in the Lord's ſight ſo great an of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence and abomination. Infinite places almoſt might be brought out of the Scriptures of the Old Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments concerning this matter; but theſe few at this time ſhall ſerve for all.</p>
                     <p>You will ſay, peradventure, theſe things pertain to
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:54673:101"/> the Jews, what have we to do with them? Indeed they pertain no leſs to us Chriſtians, than to them. For if we be the people of God, how can the Word and Law of God not appertain to us? <hi>St. Paul</hi> alledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing one Text out of the old Teſtament concludeth ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally for other Scriptures of the old Teſtament as well as that,<note place="margin">Rom. 15.</note> ſaying, <hi>Whatſoever is written before</hi> (mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the Old Teſtament,) <hi>is written for our inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction:</hi> Which Sentence is moſt ſpecially true of ſuch writings of the Old Teſtament, as contain the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mutable Law and Ordinances of God, in no age or time to be altered; nor of any perſons of any nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons or age to be diſobeyed, ſuch as the above re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hearſed places be. Notwithſtanding, for your fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſatisfying herein, according to my promiſe, I will, out of the Scriptures of the New Teſtament, or Goſpel of our Saviour Chriſt, likewiſe make a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation of the ſaid Doctrine againſt Idols or Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, and of our Duty concerning the ſame. Firſt, the Scriptures of the New Teſtament do in ſundry places make mention with rejoycing, as for a moſt excellent benefit and gift of God, that they, which received the Faith of Chriſt, were turned from their dumb and dead Images, unto the true and living God, who is to be bleſſed for ever: Namely in theſe places, the 14, and 17 of the <hi>Acts of the Apoſtles,</hi> the 11 to the <hi>Romans,</hi> and the Firſt Epiſtle to the <hi>Corinthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi> the Twelfth Chapter, to the <hi>Galatians,</hi> the 4th and the 1ſt to the <hi>Theſſalonians,</hi> the Firſt Chapter.</p>
                     <p>And likewiſe the ſaid Idols, Images, and Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipping of them, are in the Scriptures of the New Teſtament by the Spirit of God much abhorred and deteſted, and earneſtly forbidden, as appeareth both in the fore-named places, and alſo many other be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, as in the ſeventh, and Fifteenth of the <hi>Acts of the Apoſtles,</hi> the Firſt to the <hi>Romans,</hi> where is ſet forth the horrible plague of Idolaters, given over by God unto a reprobate Senſe to work all wickedneſs and abominations not to be ſpoken, as uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally ſpiritual and carnal Fornication go together.</p>
                     <pb n="189" facs="tcp:54673:101"/>
                     <p>In the firſt Epiſtle to the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> the Fifth Chapter, we are forbidden once <hi>to keep Company, or to eat and drink with ſuch as be called Brethren or Chriſtians, that do Worſhip Images.</hi> In the Fifth to the <hi>Galatians,</hi> the Worſhipping of Images is numbred amongſt the <hi>Works of the Fleſh:</hi> And in the Firſt to the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> the Tenth, it is called the <hi>ſervice of Devils, and that ſuch as uſe it ſhall be deſtroyed.</hi> And in the Sixth Chapter of the ſaid Epiſtle, and the Fifth to the <hi>Galatians,</hi> is denoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, that <hi>ſuch Image-Worſhippers ſhall never come into the inheritance of the Kingdom of Heaven.</hi> And in ſundry other places is threatned, that <hi>the wrath of God ſhall come upon all ſuch.</hi> And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Saint <hi>John</hi> in his Epiſtle,<note place="margin">1 Joh. 5. 1 Cor. 10.</note> exhorteth us <hi>as his dear Children, to beware of Images.</hi> And Saint <hi>Paul</hi> warneth us <hi>to flee from the Worſhipping of them,</hi> if we be wiſe, that is to ſay, if we care for Health, and fear Deſtruction, if we regard the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of God, and Life Everlaſting, and dread the Wrath of God, and Everlaſting Damnation. For it is not poſſible, that we ſhould be Worſhippers of Images, and the true Servants of God alſo, as Saint <hi>Paul</hi> teacheth, in the Second to the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> the Sixth Chapter, affirming expreſly that there can be no more <hi>conſent or agreement between the Temple of God</hi> (which all true Chriſtians be,) <hi>and Images, than between Righteouſneſs and <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nrighteouſneſs, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween Light and Darkneſs, between the Faithful and the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nfaithful, or between Chriſt and the Devil.</hi> Which place enforceth, both that we ſhould not Worſhip Images, and that we ſhould not have Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges in the Temple, for fear and occaſion of Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipping them, though they be of themſelves things indifferent: For the Chriſtian is the Holy Temple and lively Image of God, as the place well decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth, to ſuch as will read and weigh it. And whereas all Godly Men did ever abhor that any Kneeling and Worſhipping or Offering ſhould be uſed to themſelves when they were alive (for that
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:54673:102" rendition="simple:additions"/> it was the Honour due to God only,<note place="margin">Acts 10. Acts 14.</note>) as appeareth in the <hi>Acts</hi> of the Apoſtles by Saint <hi>Peter</hi> forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding it to <hi>Cornelius,</hi> and by Saint <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bas</hi> forbidding the ſame to the Citizens in <hi>Lyſtra:</hi> Yet we like Mad Men fall down before the dead Idols or Images of <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>Paul,</hi> and give that Honour to Stocks and Stones, which they thought abominable to be given to themſelves being alive. And the good Angel of God, as appeareth in the Book of Saint <hi>John</hi>'s Revelation, refuſed to be Kneel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed unto, when that Honour was offered him of <hi>John: Beware</hi> (ſaith the Angel,) <hi>that thou do it not, for I am thy fellow-Servant.</hi> But the evil Angel, Satan, deſireth nothing ſo much as to be kneeled unto, and thereby at once both to rob God of his due Honour, and to work the Damnation of ſuch as make him ſo low courteſie, as in the Story of the Goſpel appeareth in ſundry places. Yea, and he offered our Saviour Chriſt all Earthly goods, on the condition that he would kneel down and Worſhip him. But our Saviour repelleth Satan by the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures,<note place="margin">Matth. 4 Luke 2.</note> ſaying, <hi>It is written, thou ſhalt Worſhip thy Lord thy God, and him alone ſhalt thou ſerve.</hi> But we by not Worſhipping and ſerving God alone, (as the Scriptures teach us,) and by Worſhipping of Images, contrary to the Scriptures, pluck Satan to us, and are ready without reward to follow his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire: Yea, rather than fail, we will offer him Gifts and Oblations to receive our ſervice. But let us, Brethren, rather follow the Counſel of the good An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel of God, than the ſuggeſtion of ſubtil Satan, that wicked Angel and old Serpent; who, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the Pride whereby he firſt fell, attempteth always by ſuch Sacriledge to deprive God (whom he envieth,) of his due Honour: And (becauſe his own Face is horrible and ugly,) to convey it to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf by the Mediation of gilt Stocks and Stones, and withal to make us the Enemies of God, and his own Suppliants and Slaves, and in the end to procure us for a Reward, Everlaſting Deſtruction and Dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation.
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:54673:102"/> Therefore above all things, if we take our ſelves to be Chriſtians indeed, (as we be named,) let us credit the Word, obey the Law, and follow the Doctrine and Example of our Saviour and Maſter Chriſt, repelling Satans Suggeſtion to Idolatry and Worſhipping of Images, according to the Truth alledged and taught out of the Teſtament and Goſpel of our ſaid Heavenly Doctor and School<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maſter Jeſus Chriſt, who is God to be bleſſed for ever. <hi>Amen.</hi>

                        <hi>keep yourſelves from Images or Idols.</hi> He ſaith not now, keep yourſelves from Idolatry, as it were from the Service and Worſhipping of them; But from the Images or Idols themſelves, that is, from the very ſhape and likeneſs of them. For it were an unworthy thing, that the Image of the living God ſhould become the Image of a dead Idol. Do you not think, thoſe Perſons, which place Images and Idols in Churches and Temples, yea, ſhrine them even over the Lords Table, even as it were of purpoſe to the Worſhipping and Honouring of them, take good heed either to Saint <hi>John</hi>'s Counſel, or <hi>Tertullian's?</hi> For ſo to place Images and Idols, is it to keep themſelves from them, or elſe to receive and embrace them?</p>

                        <hi>Origen,</hi> in his Book againſt <hi>Celſus,</hi> ſaith thus: <q>Chriſtian Men and Jews, when they hear theſe words of the Law, <hi>(Thou ſhalt fear the Lord thy God, and ſhalt not make any Image,)</hi> do not only abhor the Temples, Altars, and Images of the Gods, but if need be, will rather die than they ſhould defile themſelves with any impiety.</q> And
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:54673:103"/> ſhortly after he ſaith: <q>In the Common-Wealth of the Jews, the Carver of Idols and Image-maker, was caſt far off and forbidden, leſt they ſhould have any occaſion to make Images, which might pluck certain fooliſh Perſons from God, and turn the Eyes of their Souls to the Contemplation of Earthly Things.</q> And in another place of the ſame Book; <q>It is not only (ſaith he,) a Mad and Frantick part to Worſhip Images, but alſo once to diſſemble or wink at it. And a Man may know God and his only Son, and thoſe which have had ſuch Honour given them by God, that they be called Gods: But it is not poſſible that any ſhould, by Worſhipping of Images, get any knowledge of God.</q>

                        <hi>Athanaſius</hi> in his Book againſt the Gentiles, hath theſe Words: <q>Let them tell, I pray you, how God may be known by an Image. If it be by the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of an Image, then there needeth no ſhape or form, ſeeing that God hath appeared in all mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial Creatures which do teſtifie his Glory. Now if they ſay, he is known by the form or faſhion, Is he not better to be known by the living things themſelves, whoſe faſhions the Images expreſs? For of ſurety, the glory of God ſhould be more evidently known, if it were declared by reaſonable and living Creatures, rather than by dead and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moveable Images. Therefore when ye do Grave or Paint Images, to the end to know God thereby, ſurely ye do an unworthy and unfit thing.</q> And in another place of the ſame Book he ſaith, <q>The invention of Images came of no good, but of evil, and whatſoever hath an evil beginning can never in any thing be judged good, ſeeing it is alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether naught.</q> Thus far <hi>Athanaſius,</hi> a very Ancient, Holy, and Learned Biſhop and Doctor, who judgeth both the firſt beginning and the end, and altogether of Images or Idols, to be naught.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Laclantius</hi> likewiſe, an Old and Learned Writer, in his Book of <hi>The Original of E rour,</hi> hath theſe
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:54673:104"/> words; <q>God is above Man, and is not placed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neath, but is to be ſought in the higheſt Region. Wherefore there is no doubt, but that no Religion is in that place whereſoever any Image is: For if Religion ſtand in godly things (and there is no godlineſs but in heavenly things,) then be Images without Religion.</q>

And that ye may know that Saint <hi>Jerome</hi> had this Holy and Learned Biſhop <hi>Epiphanius</hi> in moſt high Eſtimation, and therefore did Tranſlate this Epiſtle, as a Writing of Authority, hear what a Teſtimony the ſaid Saint <hi>Jerome</hi> giveth him in another place, in his <hi>Treatiſe againſt the Errours of</hi> John <hi>Biſhop of</hi> Jeruſalem, where he hath theſe words:<note place="margin">All notable Biſhops were then called Popes.</note> 
                        <q>Thou haſt (ſaith Saint <hi>Jerome,</hi>) Pope <hi>Epiphanius,</hi> which doth openly in his Letters call thee an Heretick. Surely thou art not to be preferred before him, neither for Age, nor Learning, nor Godlineſs of Life, nor by the Teſtimony of the whole World.</q> And ſhortly after in the ſame Treatiſe, ſaith Saint <hi>Jerome,</hi> Biſhop <hi>Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phanius</hi> was ever of ſo great Veneration and Eſtima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that <hi>Valens</hi> the Emperor, who was a great Perſecutor, did not once touch him. For Hereticks, being Princes, thought it their ſhame if they ſhould perſecute ſuch a notable Man. And in the <hi>Tripar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tite Eccleſiaſtical Hiſtory,</hi> the Ninth Book, and Forty Eighth Chapter, is teſtified, <q>That <hi>Epipha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius</hi> being yet alive, did work Miracles, and that after his Death, Devils,<note place="margin">Lib. 9. c. 48.</note> being expelled at his Grave or Tomb, did roar.</q> Thus you ſee what Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity Saint <hi>Jerome,</hi> and that moſt ancient Hiſtory, give unto the Holy and Learned Biſhop <hi>Epiphanius,</hi> whoſe judgment of Images in Churches and Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, then beginning by ſtealth to creep in, is worthy to be noted.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, he judged it contrary to Chriſtian Religion and the Authority of the Scriptures, to have any Images in Chriſts Church. Secondly, he rejected not only Carved, Graven, and Molten Images, but
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:54673:105"/> alſo painted Images out of Chriſts Church. Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that he regarded not whether it were the Image of Chriſt, or of any other Saint, but being an Image would not ſuffer it in the Church. Fourthly, that he did not only remove it out of the Church, but with a vehement zeal tare it in ſunder, and exhorted that a Corſe ſhould be wrapped and buried in it, judging it meet for nothing but to rot in the Earth, following herein the Example of the good King <hi>Ezechias,</hi> who brake the braſen Serpent to pieces, and burned it to Aſhes, for that Idolatry was committed to it. Laſt of all, that <hi>Epiphanius</hi> thinketh it the duty of Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gilant Biſhops, to be careful that no Images be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted in the Church, for that they be occaſion of ſcruple and offence to the people committed to their charge. Now whereas neither S. <hi>Jerome,</hi> who did tranſlate the ſame Epiſtle, nor the Authors of that moſt ancient <hi>Hiſtory Eccleſiaſtical Tripartite,</hi> (who do moſt highly commend <hi>Epiphanius,</hi> as is aforeſaid,) nor any other godly or learned Biſhop at that time, or ſhortly after, have written any thing againſt <hi>Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phanius</hi> his Judgment concerning Images: It is an evident proof, that in thoſe days, which were about four hundred years after our Saviour Chriſt, there were no Images publickly uſed and received in the Church of Chriſt, which was then much leſs corrupt, and more pure than now it is.</p>
                     <p>And whereas Images began at that time ſecretly and by ſtealth to creep out of private Mens Houſes into the Churches, and that firſt in painted Cloths and Walls, ſuch Biſhops as were godly and vigilant, when they ſpyed them, removed them away, as un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful and contrary to Chriſtian Religion, as did here <hi>Epiphanius,</hi> to whoſe Judgment you have not only Saint <hi>Jerome,</hi> the Tranſlator of his Epiſtle, and the Writer of the <hi>Hiſtory Tripartite,</hi> but alſo all the learned and godly Clerks, yea, and the whole Church of that Age, and ſo upward to our Saviour Chriſts time, by the ſpace of about four hundred years, conſenting and agreeing. This is written the
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:54673:105"/> more largely of <hi>Epiphanius,</hi> for that our Image-maintainers now adays, ſeeing themſelves ſo preſſed with this moſt plain and earneſt act and writing of <hi>Epiphanius,</hi> a Biſhop and Doctor of ſuch Antiquity and Authority, labour by all means, (but in vain againſt the Truth,) either to prove, that this Epiſtle was nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of <hi>Epiphanius</hi>'s Writing, nor Saint <hi>Jerome</hi>'s Tranſlation: <hi>Either if it be,</hi> ſay they, <hi>it is of no great force: For this</hi> Epiphanius, ſay they, <hi>was a Jew, and being converted to the Chriſtian Faith, and made a Biſhop, retained the hatred which Jews have to Images, ſtill in his mind, and ſo did and wrote againſt them as a Jew, rather than as a Chriſtian.</hi> O Jewiſh Impudency and Malice of ſuch Deviſers, it ſhould be proved, and not ſaid only, that <hi>Epipha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius</hi> was a Jew. Furthermore, concerning the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon they make, I would admit it gladly. For if <hi>Epiphanius</hi> his Judgment againſt Images is not to be admitted, for that he was born of a Jew, an Enemy to Images, which be Gods Enemies, converted to Chriſts Religion, then likewiſe followeth it, that no Sentence in the Old Doctors and Fathers, ſounding for Images, ought to be of any Authority, for that in the Primitive Church, the moſt part of Learned Writers, as <hi>Tertullian, Cyprian, Ambroſe, Auſtin,</hi> and infinite others more, were, of Gentiles, (which be Favourers and Worſhippers of Images,) conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to the Chriſtian Faith, and ſo let ſomwhat ſlip out of their Pens, ſounding for Images, rather as Gentiles than Chriſtians, as <hi>Euſebius</hi> in his <hi>Hiſtory Eccleſiaſtical,</hi> and Saint <hi>Jerome</hi> ſaith plainly, <q>That Images came firſt from the Gentiles to us Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans.</q> And much more doth it follow, that the opinion of all the Rablement of the Popiſh Church, maintaining Images, ought to be eſteemed of ſmall or no Authority, for that it is no marvel that they, which have from their Childhood been brought up amongſt Images and Idols, and have drunk in Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry almoſt with their Mothers Milk, hold with Images and Idols, and ſpeak and write for them. But indeed
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:54673:106"/> it would not be ſo much marked whether he were of a Jew or a Gentile converted unto Chriſt's Religion, that writeth, as how agreeable or contrary to Gods word he doth write, and ſo to credit or diſcredit him. Now what Gods word ſaith of Idols and Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, and the Worſhipping of them, you heard at large in the Firſt part of this Homily.</p>
                     <p>Saint <hi>Ambroſe</hi> in his Treatiſe of the Death of <hi>The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>odoſius</hi> the Emperor, ſaith, <q>
                           <hi>Helene</hi> found the Croſs and the Title on it. She Worſhipped the King, and not the Wood ſurely, (for that is an Heatheniſh Errour, and the Vanity of the wicked,) but ſhe Worſhipped him that hanged on the Croſs, and whoſe Name was Written in the Title, and ſo forth.</q> See both the godly Empreſs her fact, and Saint <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broſe</hi>'s "Judgment at once: They thought it had been an Heatheniſh Errour and Vanity of the Wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, to have Worſhipped the Croſs itſelf which was embrued with our Saviour Chriſts own precious Blood. And we fall down before every Croſs piece of Timber, which is but an Image of that Croſs.</p>
                     <p>Saint <hi>Auguſtine,</hi> the beſt Learned of all ancient Doctors, in his Forty fourth Epiſtle to <hi>Maximus,</hi> ſaith, <q>Know thou, that none of the Dead, nor any thing that is made of God, is Worſhipped as God of the Catholick Chriſtians, of whom there is a Church alſo in your Town.</q> Note, that by Saint <hi>Auguſtine,</hi> ſuch as Worſhipped the Dead, or Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, be not Catholick Chriſtians.</p>
                     <p>The ſame Saint <hi>Auguſtine</hi> teacheth in the Twelfth Book of the City of God, the Tenth Chapter, <q>That neither Temples or Churches ought to be builded or made for Martyrs or Saints, but to God alone: And that there ought no Prieſts to be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed for Martyr or Saint, but to God only.</q> The ſame Saint <hi>Auguſtine</hi> in his Book of <hi>The Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners of the Catholick Church,</hi> hath theſe words; <q>I know that many be Worſhippers of Tombs and Pictures, I know that there be many that Ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quet moſt riotouſly over the Graves of the Dead,
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:54673:106"/> and giving Meat to Dead Carkaſſes, do bury them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves upon the buried, and attribute their Glut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tony and Drunkenneſs to Religion.</q> See, he eſteemeth Worſhipping of Saints Tombs and Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctures, as good Religion as Gluttony and Drunk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enneſs, and no better at all. Saint <hi>Auguſtine</hi> great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly alloweth <hi>Marcus Varro,</hi> affirming, <q>That Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion is moſt pure without Images;</q> and ſaith himſelf, <q>Images be of more force to crooken an unhappy Soul, than to teach and inſtruct it.</q> And ſaith further, <q>Every Child, yea, every Beaſt knoweth that it is not God that they ſee.</q> Wherefore then doth the Holy Ghoſt ſo often admoniſh us of that which all Men know?

<pb n="200" facs="tcp:54673:107"/> before declared,) did notwithſtanding, by the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of the Gentiles or Heathen People that dwelt about them, fall to the Making of Images, and Worſhipping of them, and ſo to the committing of moſt abominable Idolatry, for the which God by his Holy Prophets doth moſt ſharply reprove and threaten them, and afterward did accompliſh his ſaid threatnings by extream puniſhing of them, (as is alſo above ſpecified:) Even ſo ſome of the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians in old time, which were converted, from Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipping of Idols and falſe Gods, unto the true li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving God, and to our Saviour Jeſus Chriſt, did of a certain blind zeal (as Men long accuſtomed to Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges,) Paint or Carve Images of our Saviour Chriſt, his Mother <hi>Mary,</hi> and of the Apoſtles, thinking that this was a point of Gratitude and Kindneſs to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards thoſe, by whom they had received the true knowledge of God, and the Doctrine of the Goſpel.

Where note ye, that both Saint <hi>Jerome</hi> and He agree herein, that theſe Images came in amongſt Chriſtian Men by ſuch as were Gentiles, and accuſtomed to Idols, and being converted to the Faith of Chriſt retained yet ſome Remnants of Gentility not through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly purged: For Saint <hi>Jerome</hi> calleth it an Errour manifeſtly. And the like Example we ſee in the <hi>Acts</hi> of the Apoſtles, of the Jews, who, when they were converted to Chriſt, would have brought in their Circumciſion (whereunto they were ſo long accuſtomed,) with them, into Chriſts Religion. With whom the Apoſtles (namely Saint <hi>Paul,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Act 15.</note>) had much ado for the ſtaying of that matter. But of Circumciſion was leſs marvail, for that it came firſt in by Gods Ordinance and Commandment. A Man may moſt juſtly wonder of Images ſo directly againſt Gods Holy Word and ſtrict Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, how they ſhould enter in. But Images were not yet Worſhipped in <hi>Euſebius</hi> his time, nor pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickly ſet up in Churches and Temples, and they who privately had them, did err of a certain Zeal, and not by Malice: But afterwards they crept out of private Houſes into Churches, and ſo bred firſt Superſtition, and laſt of all Idolatry amongſt Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, as hereafter ſhall appear.</p>
                     <p>In the time of <hi>Theodoſius</hi> and <hi>Martain,</hi> Emperors, who reigned about the year of our Lord 460. and 1117. years ago, when the People of the City of <hi>Nola</hi> once a year did celebrate the Birth day of Saint <hi>Foelix</hi> in the Temple, and uſed to banquet there ſumptuouſly,
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:54673:108"/> 
                        <hi>Pontius Paulinus</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Nola,</hi> cauſed the Walls of the Temple to be painted with Stories taken out of the Old Teſtament, that the People, beholding and conſidering thoſe Pictures, might the better ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtain from too much ſurfeiting and riot. And about the ſame time <hi>Aurelius Prudentius,</hi> a very learned and Chriſtian Poet, declareth how he did ſee paint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in a Church, the Hiſtory of the Paſſion of S. <hi>Caſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſian,</hi> a Schoolmaſter and Martyr, whom his own Scholars, at the Commandment of the Tyrant, tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented with the pricking or ſtabbing in of their Pointels, or Brazen Pens into his Body, and ſo by a thouſand Wounds and more (as ſaith <hi>Prudentius,</hi>) moſt cruelly ſlew him. And theſe were the firſt Paintings in Churches that were notable of Antiqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. And ſo by this example came in Painting, and afterward Images of Timber and Stone, and other matter, into the Churches of Chriſtians. Now, if ye well conſider this beginning, Men are not ſo ready to worſhip a Picture on a Wall, or in a Window, as an emboſſed and gilt Image, ſet with Pearl and Stone. And a proceſs of a Story, painted with the Geſtures and Actions of many Perſons, and commonly the ſum of the Story written withal, hath another uſe in it, than one dumb Idol or Image ſtanding by itſelf. But from learning by painted Stories, it came by little and little to Idolatry. Which when godly Men (as well Emperors and learned Biſhops, as others,) perceived, they commanded that ſuch Pictures, Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges or Idols, ſhould be uſed no more. And I will for a Declaration thereof, begin with the Decree of the ancient Chriſtian Emperors, <hi>Valens</hi> and <hi>Theodo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſius</hi> the ſecond, who reigned about four hundred years after our Saviour Chriſt's Aſcenſion, who forbad that any Images ſhould be made or painted privately: For certain it is, that there were none in Temples publickly in their time. Theſe Emperors did write unto the Captain of the Army attending on the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perors, after this ſort: <q>
                           <hi>Valens</hi> and <hi>Theodoſius</hi> Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perors, unto the Captain of the Army; Whereas
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:54673:108"/> we have a diligent care to maintain the Religion of God above, in all things, we will grant to no Man to ſet forth, grave, carve, or paint the Image of our Saviour Chriſt in Colours, Stone, or any other matter, but in what place ſoever it ſhall be found, we command that it be taken away, and that all ſuch as ſhall attempt any thing contrary to our De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees or Commandments herein, ſhall be moſt ſharply puniſhed.</q> This Decree is written in the Books named <hi>Libri Auguſtales,</hi> the Imperial Books, gathered by <hi>Tribonianus, Baſilides, Theophilus, Dioſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corus,</hi> and <hi>Satira,</hi> Men of great Authority and Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, at the Commandment of the Emperor <hi>Juſtinian,</hi> and is alledged by <hi>Petrus Crinitus,</hi> a notable learned Man, in the Ninth Book and Ninth Chapter of his Work, intituled, <hi>De honeſta Diſciplina,</hi> that is to ſay, Of honeſt Learning. Here you ſee, what Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Princes of moſt ancient times decreed againſt Images, which then began to creep in amongſt the Chriſtians. For it is certain, that by the ſpace of three hundred years and more, after the death of our Saviour Chriſt, and before theſe godly Emperors reigned, there were no Images publickly in Churches or Temples. How would the Idolaters glory, if they had ſo much Antiquity and Authority for them, as is here againſt them?</p>
                     <p>Now ſhortly after theſe days, the <hi>Goths, Vandals, Huns,</hi> and other barbarous and wicked Nations, burſt into <hi>Italy,</hi> and all parts of the Weſt Countries of <hi>Europe,</hi> with huge and mighty Armies, ſpoiled all places, deſtroyed Cities, and burned Libraries, ſo that Learning and true Religion went to wrack, and decayed incredibly. And ſo the Biſhops of thoſe later days, being of leſs Learning, and in the midſt of the Wars, taking leſs heed alſo than did the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops afore, by ignorance of Gods Word, and neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence of Biſhops, and eſpecially barbarous Princes, not rightly inſtructed in true Religion, bearing the Rule, Images came into the Church of Chriſt in the ſaid Weſt parts, where theſe barbarous People ruled,
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:54673:109"/> not now in painted Cloth only, but emboſſed in Stone, Timber, Metal, and other like matter, and were not only ſet up, but began to be worſhipped alſo. And therefore <hi>Serenus,</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Maſſile,</hi> the head Town of <hi>Gallia Narbonenſis,</hi> (now called the Province,) a godly and learned Man, who was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout ſix hundred years after our Saviour Chriſt, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the People, by occaſion of Images, fall to moſt abominable Idolatry, brake to pieces all the Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of Chriſt and Saints which were in that City, and was therefore complained upon to <hi>Gregory</hi> the firſt of that Name, Biſhop of <hi>Rome,</hi> who was the firſt learned Biſhop that did allow the open having of Images in Churches, that can be known by any Writing or Hiſtory of Antiquity. And upon this <hi>Gregory</hi> do all Image-worſhippers at this day ground their Defence. But as all things that be amiſs, have from a tolerable beginning grown worſe and worſe, till they at the laſt became intolerable: So did this matter of Images. Firſt, Men uſed privately Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries painted in Tables, Cloths, and Walls. After<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, groſs and emboſſed Images privately in their own Houſes. Then afterwards, Pictures firſt, and after them emboſſed Images began to creep into Churches, learned and godly Men ever ſpeaking a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt them. Then by uſe it was openly maintain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, That they might be in Churches, but yet for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden that they ſhould be worſhipped. Of which Opinion was <hi>Gregory,</hi> as by the ſaid <hi>Gregory</hi>'s Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle to the forenamed <hi>Serenus,</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Maſſile,</hi> plainly appeareth. Which Epiſtle is to be found in the Book of Epiſtles of <hi>Gregory,</hi> or Regiſter, in the tenth part of the fourth Epiſtle, where he hath theſe words; <q>That thou didſt forbid Images to be worſhipped, we praiſe altogether; but that thou didſt break them, we blame. For it is one thing to worſhip the Picture, and another thing by the Picture of the Story, to learn what is to be wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipped. For that which Scripture is to them that read, the ſame doth Picture perform unto Idiots,
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:54673:109"/> or the unlearned beholding, and ſo forth.</q> And after a few words; <q>Therefore it ſhould not have been broken, which was ſet up, not to be wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipped in Churches, but only to inſtruct the Minds of the ignorant. And a little after, "Thus thou ſhouldſt have ſaid, If you will have Images in the Church for that inſtruction wherefore they were made in old time, I do permit that they may be made, and that you may have them, and ſhew them, that not the ſight of the Story, which is opened by the Picture, but that worſhipping which was inconveniently given to the Pictures, did miſlike you. And if any would make Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, not to forbid them, but avoid by all means to worſhip any Image.</q> By theſe Sentences taken here and there out of <hi>Gregory</hi>'s Epiſtle to <hi>Serenus,</hi> (for it were too long to rehearſe the whole,) ye may underſtand whereunto the matter was now come ſix hundred years after Chriſt: That the having of Images or Pictures, in the Churches, were then maintained in the Weſt part of the World, (for they were not ſo forward yet in the Eaſt Church,) but the worſhipping of them was utterly forbidden. And you may withal note, That ſeeing there is no ground for worſhipping of Images in <hi>Gregory</hi>'s Writing, but a plain condemnation thereof, that ſuch as do wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip Images do unjuſtly alledge <hi>Gregory</hi> for them. And further, if Images in the Church do not teach Men according to <hi>Gregory</hi>'s Mind, but rather blind them: It followeth, that Images ſhould not be in the Church by his ſentence, who only would they ſhould be placed there, to the end that they might teach the ignorant. Wherefore, if it be declared that Images have been, and be worſhipped, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo that they teach nothing but Errours and Lyes, (which ſhall, by God's Grace, hereafter be done,) I truſt that then by <hi>Gregory</hi>'s own Determination, all Images and Image-worſhippers ſhall be overthrown. But in the mean ſeaſon, <hi>Gregory</hi>'s Authority was ſo great in all the Weſt-Church, that by his Incourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:54673:110"/> Men ſet up Images in all places: But their Judgment was not ſo good to conſider why he would have them ſet up, but they fell all on heaps to manifeſt Idolatry by worſhipping of them, which Biſhop <hi>Serenus</hi> (not without juſt cauſe,) feared would come to paſs. Now if <hi>Serenus</hi> his Judgment, thinking it meet that Images, whereunto Idolatry was committed, ſhould be deſtroyed, had taken place, Idolatry had been overthrown: For to that which is not, no Man committeth Idolatry. But of <hi>Gregory</hi>'s Opinion, thinking that Images might be ſuffered in Churches, ſo it were taught that they ſhould not be worſhipped: What ruine of Religion, and what miſchief enſued afterward to all Chriſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, Experience hath, to our great hurt and ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, proved.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, By the Schiſm riſing between the Eaſt and the Weſt Church about the ſaid Images.</p>
                     <p>Next, By the Diviſion of the Empire into two parts by the ſame occaſion of Images, to the great weakening of all Chriſtendom, whereby laſt of all, hath followed the utter overthrow of the Chriſtian Religion and Noble Empire in <hi>Greece,</hi> and all the Eaſt parts of the World, and the increaſe of <hi>Maho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>met</hi>'s falſe Religion, and the cruel Dominion and Tyranny of the Saracens and Turks, who do now hang over our Necks alſo that dwell in the Weſt parts of the World, ready at all occaſions to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>run us. And all this do we owe unto our Idols and Images, and our Idolatry in worſhipping of them.</p>

                        <note place="margin">Eutrop. lib. de re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus Ro. 23.</note>But now give you ear a little to the proceſs of the Hiſtory, wherein I do much follow the Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of <hi>Paulus Diaconus,</hi> and others joyned with <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tropius</hi> an old Writer. For though ſome of the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors were Favourers of Images; yet do they moſt plainly and at large proſecute the Hiſtories of thoſe times,<note place="margin">Platina in vitis Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantini &amp; Greg. 2.</note> whom <hi>Baptiſt Platina</hi> alſo in his Hiſtory of Popes, as in the Lives of <hi>Conſtantine</hi> and <hi>Gregory</hi> the ſecond, Biſhops of <hi>Rome,</hi> and other places (where
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:54673:110"/> he treateth of this matter,) doth chiefly follow. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter <hi>Gregory</hi>'s time, <hi>Conſtantine</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi> aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembled a Council of Biſhops in the Weſt Church, and did condemn <hi>Philippicus</hi> then Emperor, and <hi>John</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> of the Hereſie of the <hi>Monothelites,</hi> not without a cauſe indeed, but ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry juſtly. When he had ſo done, by the conſent of the learned about him, the ſaid <hi>Conſtantine</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi> cauſed the Images of the ancient Fathers, which had been at thoſe ſix Councils which were allowed and received of all Men, to be painted in the entry of Saint <hi>Peter</hi>'s Church at <hi>Rome.</hi> When the <hi>Greeks</hi> had knowledge hereof, they began to diſpute and reaſon the matter of Images with the <hi>Latins,</hi> and held this Opinion, That Images could have no place in Chriſts Church, and the <hi>Latins</hi> held the contrary, and took part with the Images. So the Eaſt and Weſt Churches, which agreed well before, upon this contention about Images fell to utter enmity, which was never well reconciled yet. But in the mean ſeaſon <hi>Philippicus</hi> and <hi>Arthemius,</hi> or <hi>Anaſtaſius</hi> Emperors, commanded Images and Pictures to be pulled down, and raſed out in every place of their Dominion.</p>
                     <p>After them came <hi>Theodoſius</hi> the Third, he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded the defaced Images to be painted again in their places: But this <hi>Theodoſius</hi> reigned but one year.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Leo,</hi> the third of that Name, ſucceeded him, who was a <hi>Syrian</hi> born, a very wiſe, godly, merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, and valiant Prince. This <hi>Leo</hi> by Proclamation commanded, That all Images, ſet up in Churches to be worſhipped, ſhould be plucked down and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faced: And required ſpecially the Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi> that he ſhould do the ſame; and himſelf in the mean ſeaſon cauſed all Images that were in the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perial City <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> to be gathered on an heap in the midſt of the City, and there publickly burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them to aſhes, and whited over, and raſed out all Pictures painted upon the Walls of the Temples, and
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:54673:111"/> puniſhed ſharply divers maintainers of Images. And when ſome did therefore report him to be a Tyrant, he anſwered. <q>That ſuch of all other were moſt juſtly puniſhed, who neither Worſhipped God aright, nor regarded the Imperial Majeſty and Authority, but maliciouſly rebelled againſt whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom and profitable Laws.</q> When <hi>Gregorius,</hi> the Third of that Name, Biſhop of <hi>Rome,</hi> heard of the Emperors doings in <hi>Greece</hi> concerning the Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, he aſſembled a Council of Italian Biſhops againſt him, and there made Decrees for Images, and that more Reverence and Honour ſhould yet be given to them than was before, and ſtirred up the Italians againſt the Emperor, firſt at <hi>Ravenna,</hi> and moved them to Rebellion.<note place="margin">Treaſon and Rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion for the defence of Images.</note> And as <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſpurgenſis</hi> and <hi>Antho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius,</hi> Biſhops of <hi>Florence,</hi> teſtifie in their Chroni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles, he cauſed <hi>Rome</hi> and all <hi>Italy,</hi> at the leaſt, to refuſe Obedience, and the payment of any more Tribute to the Emperor: And ſo by Treaſon and Rebellion maintained their Idolatry. Which Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, other Biſhops of <hi>Rome</hi> have continually fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed, and gone through withal moſt ſtoutly.</p>
                     <p>After this <hi>Leo,</hi> who Reigned Thirty four years, ſucceeded his Son <hi>Conſtantine</hi> the Fifth, who after his Fathers example, kept Images out of the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, and being moved with the Council which <hi>Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gory</hi> had aſſembled in <hi>Italy</hi> for Images againſt his Father: He alſo aſſembled a Council of all the Learned Men and Biſhops of <hi>Aſia</hi> and <hi>Greece,</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though ſome Writers place this Council in <hi>Leo Iſau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricus,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">A Council againſt I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mages.</note> his Fathers later days. In this great Aſſembly they ſate in Council from the Fourth of the <hi>Idus</hi> of <hi>February,</hi> to the ſixth of the <hi>Idus</hi> of <hi>Auguſt,</hi> and made concerning the uſe of Images, this Decree. <q>It is not lawful for them that believe in God through Jeſus Chriſt, to have any Images, neither of the Creator, nor of any Creatures, ſet up in Temples to be Worſhipped; but rather that all things by the Law of God, and for the avoiding of Offence, ought to be taken out of the Churches.</q> And
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:54673:111"/> this Decree was executed in all places where any Images were found in <hi>Aſia</hi> or <hi>Greece.</hi> And the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror ſent the Determination of this Council holden at <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> to <hi>Paul</hi> then Biſhop of <hi>Rome,</hi> and commanded him to caſt all Images out of the Churches: Which he (truſting in the Friendſhip of <hi>Pipine</hi> a Mighty Prince,) refuſed to do. And both he and his Succeſſor <hi>Stephanus</hi> the Third, (who aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembled another Council in <hi>Italy</hi> for Images,) con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned the Emperor and the Council of <hi>Conſtanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nople</hi> of Hereſie, and made a Decree, <hi>That the Holy Images, (for ſo they called them,) of Chriſt, the Bleſſed Virgin, and other Saints, were indeed worthy Honour and Worſhipping.</hi> When <hi>Constantine</hi> was dead, <hi>Leo</hi> the Fourth his Son Reigned after him, who Married a Woman of the City of <hi>Athens,</hi> named <hi>Theodora,</hi> who alſo was called <hi>Irene,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Or Eirene.</note> by whom he had a Son, named <hi>Conſtantine</hi> the Sixth, and, dying whilſt his Son was yet young, left the Regiment of the Empire, and Governance of his young Son to his Wife <hi>Irene.</hi> Theſe things were done in the Church about the year of our Lord 760. Note here I pray you in this proceſs of the Story, that in the Churches of <hi>Aſia</hi> and <hi>Greece,</hi> there were no Images publickly by the ſpace of almoſt Seven Hundred years. And there is no doubt but the Primitive Church next the Apoſtles time was moſt pure. Note alſo, that when the Contention began about Images, how of Six Chriſtian Emperors, who were the chief Magiſtrates by Gods Law to be obeyed, only one, which was <hi>Theodoſius,</hi> who Reigned but one year, held with Images. All the other Emperors, and all the Learned Men and Biſhops of the Eaſt Church, and that in aſſembled Councils, condemned them, beſides the two Emperors before mentioned, <hi>Valens</hi> and <hi>Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doſius</hi> the Second, who were long before theſe times, who ſtrictly forbad that any Images ſhould be made. And univerſally after this time, all the Emperors of <hi>Greece</hi> (only <hi>Theodoſius</hi> excepted,) de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed continually all Images. Now on the contrary
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:54673:112"/> part, note ye, that the Biſhops of <hi>Rome,</hi> being no ordinary Magiſtrates appointed of God, out of their Dioceſs, but Uſurpers of Princes Authority, contrary to Gods Word, were the Maintainers of Images againſt Gods Word, and Stirrers up of Sedition and Rebellion, and Workers of continual Treaſon againſt their Sovereign Lords, contrary to Gods Law, and the Ordinances of all Human Laws, being not only Enemies to God, but alſo Rebels and Traytors againſt their Princes. Theſe be the firſt bringers in of Images openly into Churches, Theſe be the maintainers of them in the Churches, and theſe be the means whereby they have maintained them: To wit, Conſpiracy, Treaſon, and Rebellion againſt God and their Princes.</p>
                     <p>Now to proceed in the Hiſtory, moſt worthy to be known. In the Nonage of <hi>Conſtantine</hi> the Sixth, the Empreſs <hi>Irene</hi> his Mother, in whoſe Hands the Regiment of the Empire remained, was governed much by the advice of <hi>Theodore</hi> Biſhop, and <hi>Thara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſius</hi> Patriarch of <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> who practiſed and held with the Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi> in maintaining of Images moſt earneſtly. By whoſe Counſel and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treaty, the Empreſs firſt moſt wickedly digged up the Body of her Father in Law <hi>Conſtantine</hi> the Fifth, and commanded it to be openly burned, and the Aſhes to be thrown into the Sea. Which Example (as the conſtant report goeth,) had like to have been put in practice with Princes Corſes in our days, had the Authority of the Holy Father continued but a little longer. The cauſe, why the Empreſs <hi>Irene</hi> thus uſed her Father in Law, was, for that he, when he was alive, had deſtroyed Images, and had taken away the ſumptuous Ornaments of Churches, ſaying, <q>That Chriſt, whoſe Temples they were, allowed Poverty, and not Pearls and precious Stones.</q> Afterward the ſaid <hi>Irene</hi> at the perſuaſion of <hi>Adrian</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Rome,</hi> and <hi>Paul</hi> the Patriarch of <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantinople</hi> and his Succeſſor <hi>Tharaſius</hi> aſſembled a Council of the Biſhops of <hi>Aſia</hi> and <hi>Greece,</hi> at the
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:54673:112"/> City <hi>Nicea,</hi> where the Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi>'s Legates, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Preſidents of the Council, and ordering all things as they liſted, the Council which was aſſembled before under the Emperor <hi>Conſtantine</hi> the Fifth, and had decreed that all Images ſhould be deſtroyed, was Condemned as an Heretical Council and Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly: And a Decree was made, That Images ſhould be put up in all the Churches of <hi>Greece,</hi> and that Honour and Worſhip alſo ſhould be given unto the ſaid Images. And ſo the Empreſs, ſparing no dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence in ſetting up of Images,<note place="margin">A Decree that Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges ſhould be Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipped.</note> nor coſt in decking them in all Churches, made <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> within a ſhort time altogether like <hi>Rome</hi> itſelf. And now you may ſee that come to paſs, which Biſhop <hi>Serenus</hi> feared, and <hi>Gregory</hi> the Firſt forbad in vain; to wit, that Images ſhould in no wiſe be Worſhipped. For now not only the Simple and Unwiſe, (unto whom Images, as the Scriptures teach, be ſpecially a ſnare,) but the Biſhops and Learned Men alſo, fall to Idolatry by occaſion of Images, yea, and make Decrees and Laws for the maintenance of the ſame. So hard is it, and indeed impoſſible any long time to have Images publickly in Churches and Temples without Idolatry, as by the ſpace of little more than One Hundred years betwixt <hi>Gregory</hi> the Firſt, forbidding moſt ſtrictly the Worſhipping of Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, and <hi>Gregory</hi> the Third, <hi>Paul,</hi> and <hi>Leo</hi> the Third, Biſhops of <hi>Rome,</hi> with this Council, Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding and Decreeing that Images ſhould be Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipped, moſt evidently appeareth.</p>
                     <p>Now when <hi>Conſtantine</hi> the young Emperor came to the Age of Twenty years, he was daily in leſs and leſs eſtimation. For ſuch as were about his Mother perſuaded her, that it was Gods Determination that ſhe ſhould Reign alone, and not her Son with her. The Ambitious Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, believing the ſame, deprived her Son of all Imperial Dignity, and compelled all the Men of War, with their Captains, to Swear to her that they would not ſuffer her Son <hi>Conſtantine</hi> to Reign

                     <p>Wherefore they be convict of fooliſhneſs and wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs in making of Images of God, or the Trini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, for that no Image of God ought, or can be made, as by the Scriptures and good Reaſon evidently ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth, Yea, and once to deſire an Image of God, cometh of Infidelity, thinking not God to be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, except they might ſee ſome ſign or image of him, as appeareth by the Hebrews in the wilderneſs, willing <hi>Aaron</hi> to make them gods whom they might ſee go before them. Where they object, that ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Iſaiah</hi> and <hi>Daniel,</hi> by certain deſcriptions of God, as ſitting on a high ſeat, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Why may not a Painter likewiſe ſet him forth in colours to be ſeen, as it were a Judge ſitting on a Throne, as well as he is deſcribed in Writing by the Prophets, ſeeing that Scripture or Writing, and Picture differ but a little? Firſt, it is to be anſwered, that things forbidden by Gods Word, as Painting of Images of God, and things permitted of God, as ſuch deſcriptions uſed of the Prophets, be not all one: Neither ought, nor can Man's Reaſon (although it ſhew never ſo good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,) prevail any thing againſt God's expreſs Word, and plain Statute-Law, as I may well term it. Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thermore, the Scripture, although it have certain deſcriptions of God, yet if you read forward, it ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poundeth it ſelf, declaring that God is a pure Spirit, Infinite, who repleniſheth Heaven and Earth, which the Picture doth not, nor expoundeth it ſelf, but rather when it hath ſet God forth in a bodily ſimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litude, leaveth a Man there, and will eaſily bring one into the Hereſie of the <hi>Anthropomorphites,</hi> thinking
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:54673:119"/> God to have Hands and Feet, and to ſit as a Man doth: which they that do (ſaith <hi>St. Auguſtine,</hi>) in his Book <hi>De fide &amp; ſymbolo, cap.</hi> 7.) fall into that Sacriledge which the Apoſtle deteſteth in thoſe, who have changed the Glory of the incorruptible God, into the ſimilitude of a corruptible Man. For it is wickedneſs for a Chriſtian to erect ſuch an Image to God in a Temple, and much more wickedneſs to erect ſuch an one in his Heart, by believing of it. But to this they reply, that, this reaſon notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, Images of Chriſt may be made, for that he took upon him fleſh, and became Man. It were well that they would firſt grant, that they have hitherto done moſt wickedly, in making and maintaining of Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of God, and of the Trinity in every place, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of they are by force of God's Word, and good Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon convicted; and then to deſcend to the Tryal for other Images.</p>
                     <p>Now concerning their Objection, that an Image of Chriſt may be made, the Anſwer is eaſie: For in God's Word and Religion it is not only required whether a thing may be done, or no: But alſo, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it be lawful and agreeable to God's Word to be done, or no. For all wickedneſs may be, and is dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly done, which yet ought not to be done. And the words of the reaſons above alledged out of the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures are, that Images neither ought, nor can be made unto God. Wherfore to reply, that Images of Chriſt may be made, except withal it be proved that it is law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful for them to be made, is, rather than to hold ones peace to ſay ſomewhat, but nothing to the purpoſe. And yet it appeareth that no Image can be made of Chriſt, but a lying Image (as the Scripture peculi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arly calleth Images, lies,) for Chriſt is God and Man. Seeing therefore,<note place="margin">Rom. 1.</note> that for the Godhead, which is the moſt excellent part, no Images can be made, it is falſly called the Image of Chriſt. Wherefore Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of Chriſt be not only defects, but alſo lies. Which reaſon ſerveth alſo for the Images of Saints,
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:54673:119"/> whoſe Souls, the moſt excellent parts of them, can by no Images be preſented and expreſſed. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, they be no Images of Saints, whoſe Souls reign in joy with God, but of the Bodies of Saints, which as yet lie putrefied in the Graves. Furthermore, no true Image can be made of Chriſt's Body, for it is unknown now of what Form and Counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance he was. And there be in <hi>Greece</hi> and at <hi>Rome,</hi> and in other places, divers Images of Chriſt, and none of them like to other, and yet every of them affirmeth, that theirs is the true and lively Image of Chriſt, which cannot poſſibly be. Wherefore, as ſoon as an Image of Chriſt is made, by and by is a Lye made of him, which by God's Word is for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden. Which alſo is true of the Images of any Saints of Antiquity, for that it is unknown of what Form and Countenance they were. Wherefore, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that Religion ought to be grounded upon Truth, Images, which cannot be without Lies, ought not to be made, or put to any uſe of Religion, or to be pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced in Churches and Temples, places peculiarly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed to true Religion and Service of God. And thus much, that no true Image of God, our Saviour Chriſt, or his Saints can be made: Wherewithal is alſo confuted that their allegation, that Images be the Lay-mens Books. For it is evident by that which is afore-rehearſed, that they teach no things of God, of our Saviour Chriſt, and of his Saints, but Lies and Errors. Wherefore, either they be no Books, or if they be, they be falſe and lying Books, the teachers of all Error.</p>
                     <p>And now if it ſhould be admitted and granted, that an Image of Chriſt could truly be made, yet it is unlawful that it ſhould be made; yea, or that tho Image of any Saint ſhould be made, ſpecially to be ſet up in Temples, to the great and unavoidable dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of Idolatry, as hereafter ſhall be proved.</p>

And S. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> (as is before alledged,<note place="margin">Lib. 4. c. 3. de Civ. Dei in Pſ 36. &amp; 113.</note>) greatly alloweth <hi>M.

Wherefore did they not (I pray you,) conform themſelves to the Gentiles in making of Images, but, for lack of them, ſuſtained their heavy diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, if they had taken it to be lawful by Gods Word to have Images? It is evident therefore, that they took all Images to be unlawful in the Church or Temple of God, and therefore had none, (though the Gentiles therefore were moſt highly diſpleaſed,) following this rule,<note place="margin">Acts 5.</note> 
                        <hi>We muſt obey God rather than Men.</hi> And <hi>Zephyrus,</hi> in his Notes upon the Apology of <hi>Tertullian,</hi> gathereth, that all his vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment perſuaſion ſhould be but cold, except we know this once for all, that Chriſtian Men in his time did moſt hate Images, with their Ornaments.

                     <p>And therefore the Primitive Church, which is ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially to be followed as moſt incorrupt and pure, had publickly in Churches neither Idols of the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles, nor any other Images, as things directly for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden by Gods Word. And thus it is declared by Gods Word, the Sentences of the Doctors, and the Judgment of the Primitive Church, which was moſt pure and ſincere, that all Images, as well ours, as the Idols of the Gentiles, be by Gods Word for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden, and therefore unlawful, ſpecially in Temples and Churches.</p>

                     <p>Now if they (as their cuſtom is,) flee to this an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, that Gods word forbiddeth not abſolutely all Images to be made, but that they ſhould not be made to be Worſhipped, and that therefore we may have Images, ſo we worſhip them not, for that they be things indifferent, which may be abuſed, or well uſed. Which ſeemeth alſo to be the Judgment of <hi>Damaſcene</hi> and <hi>Gregory</hi> the firſt, as is above declared.

                     <p>Well then, we be come to their Second Allega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which in part we would not ſtick to grant them. For we are not ſo Superſtitious or Scrupu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous, that we do ahhor either Flowers wrought in Carpets, Hangings, and other Arras, either Images of Princes, Printed or Stamped in their Coins, which when Chriſt did ſee in a Roman Coin, we read not that he reprehended it, neither do we condemn the Arts of Painting and Image-making, as wicked of themſelves. But we would admit and grant them, that Images uſed for no Religion, or Superſtition rather, we mean Images of none Worſhipped, nor in danger to be Worſhipped of any, may be ſuffered. But Images, placed publickly in Temples, cannot poſſibly be without danger of Worſhipping and Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry, wherefore they are not publickly to be had or ſuffered in Temples and Churches.

<pb n="230" facs="tcp:54673:122"/> but rather offered themſelves to the Death, than to aſſent that Images ſhould once be placed in the Temple of God, neither would they ſuffer any Image-maker among them. And <hi>Origen</hi> added this cauſe, leſt their Minds ſhould be plucked from GOD to the Contemplation of Earthly Things. And they are much commended for this earneſt zeal, in main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining of GOD'S Honour and true Religion. And Truth it is, that the Jews and Turks, who abhor Images and Idols as directly forbidden by GOD'S Word, will never come to the Truth of our Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, whilſt the ſtumbling blocks of Images remain amongſt us, and lie in their way. If they object yet the braſen Serpent which <hi>Moſes</hi> did ſet up, or the Images of the Cherubims, or any other Images which the Jews had in their Temple, the anſwer is eaſie: We muſt in Religion obey Gods General Law, which bindeth all Men, and not follow Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples of particular Diſpenſation, which be no war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rants for us: Elſe we may by the ſame reaſon re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume Circumciſion and Sacrificing of Beaſts, and other Rites permitted to the Jews.

                     <p>Secondly, for that they are Worſhipped in ſundry places now in our time alſo.</p>
                     <p>And Thirdly, for that it is impoſſible that Images of God, Chriſt, or his Saints, can be ſuffered (eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially in Temples and Churches,) any while or ſpace, without Worſhipping of them: And that Idolatry, which is moſt abominable before God, cannot poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly be eſcaped and avoided, without the aboliſhing and deſtruction of Images and Pictures in Temples and Churches, for that Idolatry is to Images, ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally in Temples and Churches, an inſeparable acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent (as they term it,) ſo that Images in Churches and Idolatry go always both together, and that therefore the one cannot be avoided, except the other (ſpecially in all publick places,) be deſtroyed. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, to make the Images, and publickly to ſet them up in the Temples and Churches, places appointed peculiarly to the ſervice of God, is to make Images to the uſe of Religion, and not only againſt this Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept, <hi>Thou ſhalt make no manner of Images;</hi> but againſt this alſo, <hi>Thou ſhalt not bowe down to them, nor Worſhip them.</hi>

                     <p>And the full proof of that which in the beginning of the firſt part of this Treatiſe was touched, is here to be made and performed: To wit, that our Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, and Idols of the Gentiles be all one, as well in the things themſelves, as alſo in that our Images have been before, be now, and ever will be Worſhipped, in like form and manner, as the Idols of the Gentiles were Worſhipped, ſo long as they be ſuffered in Churches and Temples.</p>
                     <p>Whereupon it followeth, that our Images in Churches have been, be, and ever will be none other but abominable Idols, and be therefore no things in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different. And every of theſe parts ſhall be proved in order, as hereafter followeth.</p>

For where no Images be, they have no ſuch means. <hi>Terentius Varro</hi> ſheweth, that there were Three Hundred Jupiters in his time; there were no fewer <hi>Veneres</hi> and <hi>Diana</hi>'s; we had no few<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er <hi>Chriſtophers,</hi> Ladies, and <hi>Mary Magdalens,</hi> and other Saints, <hi>Oenomaus,</hi> and <hi>Heſiodus</hi> ſhew, that in their time there were Thirty Thouſand Gods. I think we had no fewer Saints, to whom we gave the Honour due to God. And they have not only ſpoiled the true living God of his due Honour in Temples, Cities, Countries, and Lands, by ſuch devices and inventions as the Gentiles Idolaters have done before
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:54673:124"/> them: But the Sea and Waters have as well ſpecial Saints with them, as they had Gods with the Gentiles, <hi>Neptune, Triton, Nereus, Caſtor</hi> and <hi>Pollux, Venus,</hi> and ſuch other: In whoſe places be come Saint <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtopher,</hi> Saint <hi>Clement,</hi> and divers other, and ſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly our Lady, to whom Shipmen Sing <hi>Ave, maris ſtella.</hi> Neither hath the Fire ſcaped the Idolatrous inventions. For inſtead of <hi>Vulcan</hi> and <hi>Veſta,</hi> the Gentiles Gods of the Fire, our Men have placed Saint <hi>Agatha,</hi> and make Letters on her day for to quench Fire with. Every Artificer and Profeſſion hath his ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial Saint, as a peculiar God. As for Example, Scholars have Saint <hi>Nicholas</hi> and Saint <hi>Gregory;</hi> Pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, Saint <hi>Luke;</hi> neither lack Souldiers their <hi>Mars,</hi> nor Lovers their <hi>Venus,</hi> amongſt Chriſtians.

What diſhonour do the Creatures to their Creator and Maker! And if we remember God ſomtimes, yet becauſe we doubt of his ability or will to help, we joyn to him another Helper, as if he were a Noun Adjective, uſing theſe ſayings; ſuch as learn, God and Saint <hi>Nicholas</hi> be my ſpeed: Such as neeſe, God help and Saint <hi>John:</hi>

For, is there not one God only, who by his Power and Wiſdom made all things, and by his Providence governeth the ſame? And by his Goodneſs maintaineth and ſaveth them? Be not <hi>all things of him, by him, and through him?</hi> Why doſt thou turn from the Creator to the Creatures? This is the manner of the Gentiles Idolaters: But thou art a Chriſtian, and therefore by Chriſt alone haſt acceſs to God the Father, and help of him only. Theſe things are not written to any reproach of the Saints themſelves, who were the true Servants of God, and did give all honour to him, taking none unto themſelves, and are bleſſed Souls with God; but againſt our Fooliſhneſs and Wickedneſs, making of the true Servants of God, falſe Gods, by attribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting to them the Power and Honour which is Gods, and due to him only. And for that we have ſuch Opinions of the power and ready help of Saints, all our Legends, Hymns, Sequences, and Maſſes, did contain Stories, Lauds, and Praiſes of them, and Prayers to them; yea, and Sermons alſo altogether of them, and to their Praiſes, Gods Word being clean laid aſide. And this we do altogether agreeable to the Saints, as did the Gentiles Idolaters to their falſe Gods. For theſe Opinions which Men have had of mortal Perſons, were they never ſo holy, the old moſt godly and learned Chriſtians have written a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the feigned Gods of the Gentiles, and Chriſtian Princes have deſtroyed their Images; who, if they were now living, would doubtleſs likewiſe both write againſt our falſe Opinions of Saints, and alſo deſtroy their Images. For it is evident, that our Image-maintainers have the ſame Opinion of Saints which the Gentiles had of their falſe Gods, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by are moved to make them Images as the Gentiles did. If anſwer be made, that they make Saints but Interceſſors to God, and means for ſuch things as they would obtain of God: That is, even after the
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:54673:125"/> Gentiles Idolatrous uſage, to make them of Saints, Gods,<note place="margin">Medioximi Dii.</note> called <hi>Dii Medioximi,</hi> to be mean Interceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors and Helpers to God, as though he did not hear, or ſhould be weary if he did all alone. So did the Gentiles teach, that there was one chief Power working by other, as means, and ſo they made all Gods ſubject to Fate or Deſtiny; as <hi>Lucian,</hi> in his Dialogues, feigneth that <hi>Neptune</hi> made ſuit to <hi>Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cury,</hi> that he might ſpeak with <hi>Jupiter.</hi> And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in this alſo, it is moſt evident, that our Image-maintainers be all one in Opinion with the Gentiles Idolaters.</p>
                     <p>Now remaineth the third part, that their Rites and Ceremonies in honouring and worſhipping of the Images or Saints be all one with the Rites which the Gentiles Idolaters uſed in honouring their Idols. Firſt, what meaneth it, that Chriſtians, after the example of the Gentiles Idolaters, go on pilgrimage to viſit Images, where they have the like at home, but that they have a greater Opinion of Holineſs and Virtue in ſome Images, than other ſome, like as the Gentiles Idolaters had? which is the readieſt way to bring them to Idolatry by worſhipping of them, and directly againſt Gods Word, who ſaith, <hi>Seek me,</hi>

                     </p>
                     <p>What meaneth it, that Chriſtian Men, after the uſe of the Gentiles Idolaters, cap and kneel before Images? which, if they had any Senſe and Gratitude, would kneel before Men, Carpenters, Maſons, Plai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterers, Founders, and Goldſmiths, their Makers and Framers, by whoſe means they have attained this Honour, which elſe ſhould have been evil-favoured and rude Lumps of Clay, or Plaiſter, pieces of Tim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, Stone, or Metal, without Shape or Faſhion, and ſo without all Eſtimation and Honour, as that Idol in the Pagan Poet confeſſeth, ſaying,<note place="margin">Horatius.</note> I was once a vile Block, but now I am become a God, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> What a fond thing is it for Man,<note place="margin">Adorare.</note> who hath Life and Reaſon, to bowe himſelf to a dead and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenſible Image, the Work of his own Hand?<note place="margin">Gen. 23. and 33.</note> Is not this ſtooping and kneeling before them, Adoration of them, which is forbidden ſo earneſtly by Gods Word?

Apoc. 19.</note> which the Saints themſelves, <hi>Peter, Paul,</hi> and <hi>Barnabas</hi> would not to be given them being alive; which the Angel of God forbiddeth to be given to him. And if they ſay, they exhibit ſuch Honour not to the Image, but to the Saint whom it repreſenteth, they are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>victed of folly, to believe that they pleaſe Saints with that Honour, which they abhor as a ſpoil of Gods Honour: For they be no Changelings; but now both having greater Underſtanding, and more fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent Love of God, do more abhor to deprive him of his due Honour: And being now like unto the Angels of God, do with Angels flee to take unto them by Sacriledge the Honour due to God: And herewithal is confuted their lewd Diſtinction of <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tria</hi>
                        <pb n="238" facs="tcp:54673:126"/> and <hi>Dulia,</hi> where it is evident, that the Saints of God cannot abide, that as much as any outward worſhipping be done or exhibited to them. But Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan, Gods Enemy, deſiring to rob God of his Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, deſireth exceedingly that ſuch Honour might be given to him.<note place="margin">Matth. 4.</note> Wherefore thoſe which give the Honour, due to the Creator, to any Creature, do ſervice acceptable to no Saints, who be the Friends of God, but unto Satan, God and Mans mortal and ſworn Enemy.

                     <p>And furthermore, in that they ſay, that they do not worſhip the Images, as the Gentiles did their Idols, but God and the Saints whom the Images do repreſent, and therefore that their doings before Images be not like the Idolatry of the Gentiles be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore their Idols; Saint <hi>Auguſtine, Lactantius,</hi> and <hi>Clemens,</hi> do prove evidently, that by this their an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, they be all one with the Gentiles Idolaters. The Gentiles (ſaith Saint <hi>Auguſtine,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Auguſt. Pſal. 135.</note>) which ſeem to be of the purer Religion, ſay, We worſhip not the Images, but by the corporal Image, we do behold the ſigns of the things which we ought to wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip.</p>
                     <p>And <hi>Lactantius</hi> ſaith, The Gentiles ſay, We fear not the Images, but them after whoſe likeneſs the Images be made,<note place="margin">Lactan. l. 2. inſt.</note> and to whoſe Names they be conſecrated. Thus far <hi>Lactantius.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And <hi>Clemens</hi> ſaith, That Serpent, the Devil, ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereth theſe words by the Mouth of certain Men, We, to the Honour of the inviſible God, worſhip viſible Images: Which ſurely is moſt falſe. See how in uſing the ſame excuſes which the Gentiles Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters pretended, they ſhew themſelves to joyn with them in Idolatry. For notwithſtanding this excuſe, Saint <hi>Auguſtine, Clemens,</hi> and <hi>Lactantius</hi> prove
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:54673:126"/> them Idolaters. And <hi>Clemens</hi> ſaith, That the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent, the Devil, putteth ſuch excuſes in the Mouth of Idolaters. And the Scriptures ſay, They wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip the Stocks and Stones (notwithſtanding this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe,) even as our Image-maintainers do. And <hi>Eze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kiel</hi> therefore calleth the Gods of the <hi>Aſſyrians,</hi> Stocks and Stones, although they were but Images of their Gods. So are our Images of God and the Saints named by the Names of God and his Saints, after the uſe of the Gentiles.</p>
                     <p>And the ſame <hi>Clemens</hi> ſaith thus in the ſame Book, They dare not give the Name of the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour to any other, for he puniſheth his Offender and Traytor by and by: But they dare give the Name of God to others, becauſe he for Repentance ſuffereth his Offenders. And even ſo do our Image-worſhippers give both Names of God and the Saints, and alſo the Honour due to God, to their Images, even as did the Gentiles Idolaters to their Idols. What ſhould it mean that they, according as did the Gentiles Idolaters, light Candles at Noon-time, or at Midnight, before them, but therewith to honour them? For other uſe is there none in ſo doing. For in the Day it needeth not, but was ever a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verb of fooliſhneſs, to light a Candle at Noon-time. And in the Night, it availeth not to light a Candle before the blind, and God hath neither uſe nor ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour thereof. And concerning this Candle-lighting, it is notable that <hi>Lactantius</hi> above a thouſand years ago hath written, after this manner;<note place="margin">Lib. 6. Inſtit. cap. 2.</note> If they would behold the heavenly Light of the Sun, then ſhould they perceive that God hath no need of their Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dles, who for the uſe of Man hath made ſo good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly a Light. And whereas in ſo little a Circle of the Sun, which, for the great diſtance, ſeemeth to be no greater than a Mans Head, there is ſo great bright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, that the ſight of Mans Eye is not able to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold it, but if one ſtedfaſtly look upon it a while,
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:54673:127"/> his Eyes will be dulled and blinded with darkneſs How great Light, how great Clearneſs may we think to be with God, with whom is no Night nor Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs? and ſo forth.</p>
                     <p>And by and by he ſaith, Seemeth he therefore to be in his right mind, who offereth up to the Giver of Light, the Light of a Wax-Candle for a Gift? He requireth another Light of us, which is not ſmoaky, but bright and clear, even the Light of the Mind and Underſtanding.</p>
                     <p>And ſhortly after he ſaith, But their Gods, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they be Earthy, have need of Light, leſt they remain in Darkneſs, whoſe Worſhippers, becauſe they underſtand no Heavenly thing, do draw Religion, which they uſe, down to the Earth, in the which, being dark of nature, is need of Light. Wherefore they give to their Gods no Heavenly, but the Earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Underſtanding of Mortal Men. And therefore they believe thoſe things to be neceſſary and pleaſant unto them, which are ſo to us, who have need ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of Meat when we be hungry, or Drink when we be thirſty, or Clothing when we be a cold, or when the Sun is ſet, Candle-light, that we may ſee. Thus far <hi>Lactantius,</hi> and much more, too long here to write, of Candle-lighting in Temples before Images and Idols for Religion: Whereby appeareth both the fooliſhneſs thereof, and alſo that in Opinion and Act, we do agree altogether in our Candle-Religion with the Gentiles Idolaters. What meaneth it that they, after the example of the Gentiles Idolaters, burn Incenſe, offer up Gold to Images, hang up Crut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, Chains, and Ships, Legs, Arms, and whole Men and Women of Wax, before Images, as though by them, or Saints, (as they ſay,) they were deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered from Lameneſs, Sickneſs, Captivity or Ship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wrack? Is not this <hi>colere imagines,</hi> to worſhip Images, ſo earneſtly forbidden in Gods Word?

Do not all Stories Eccleſiaſtical declare, that our Holy Martyrs, rather than they would bow and kneel, or offer up one crumb of Incenſe before an Image or Idol, have ſuffered a thouſand kinds of moſt horrible and dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful death? And what excuſes ſoever they make, yet that all this running on Pilgrimage, burning of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſe and Candles, hanging up of Crutchets, Chains, Ships, Arms, Legs, and whole Men and Women of Wax, kneeling and holding up of hands, is done to the Images, appeareth by this, that where no Images be, or where they have been, and be taken away, they do no ſuch things at all. But all the places frequented when the Images were there, now they be taken away, be forſaken and left deſert; nay, now they hate and abhor the place deadly; which is an evident proof, that that which they did before, was done in reſpect of the Images. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, when we ſee Men and Women on heaps go on Pilgrimage to Images, kneel before them, hold up their hands before them, ſet up Candles, burn Incenſe before them, offer up Gold and Silver unto them, hang up Ships, Crutchets, Chains, Men and Women of Wax before them, attributing health and ſafeguard, the gifts of God, to them, or the Saints whom they repreſent, as they rather would have it; who, I ſay, who can doubt, but that our Image-maintainers, agreeing in all idolatrous Opinions, outward Rites and Ceremonies with the Gentiles Idolaters, agree alſo with them in committing moſt abominable Idolatry: And to increaſe this madneſs, wicked men which have the keeping of ſuch
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:54673:128"/> Images, for their greater lucre and advantage, after the example of the Gentiles Idolaters, have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported and ſpread abroad, as well by lying tales, as written fables, divers Miracles of Images. As that ſuch an Image miraculouſly was ſent from Heaven, even like the <hi>Palladium,</hi> or <hi>Magna Diana Epheſiorum.</hi> Such another was as miraculouſly found in the Earth, as the Mans Head was in the <hi>Capitol,</hi> or the Horſe head in <hi>Capua.</hi> Such an Image was brought by Angels. Such an one came it ſelf far from the Eaſt to the Weſt, as Dame <hi>Fortune</hi> fled to <hi>Rome.</hi> Such an Image of our Lady was painted by St. <hi>Luke,</hi> whom of a Phyſician they have made a Painter for that purpoſe. Such an one an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred yokes of Oxen could not move, like <hi>Bona Dea,</hi> whom the Ship could not carry; or <hi>Jupiter Olym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pius,</hi> which laught the Artificers to ſcorn that went about to remove him to <hi>Rome.</hi> Some Images, though they were hard and ſtony, yet for tender heart and pity, wept. Some, like <hi>Caſtor</hi> and <hi>Pollux,</hi> helping their Friends in Battel, ſweat, as Marble Pillars do in dampiſh weather. Some ſpeak more monſtrouſly than ever did <hi>Balaam</hi>'s Aſs, who had life and breath in him. Such a Cripple came and ſaluted this Saint of Oak, and by and by he was made whole, and lo, here hangeth his Crutch. Such an one in a Tempeſt vowed to St. <hi>Chriſtopher,</hi> and ſcaped, and behold, here is his Ship of Wax. Such an one by St. <hi>Leonard</hi>'s help brake out of Priſon, and ſee where his Fetters hang. And infinite thouſands more Miracles, by like or more ſhameleſs lies were reported. Thus do our Image-maintainers in earneſt apply to their Images, all ſuch Miracles, as the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles have feigned of their Idols. And if it were to be admitted, that ſome miraculous acts were by illuſion of the Devil done where Images be: (For it is evident that the moſt part were feigned lies, and crafty juglings of men) yet followeth it not therefore, that ſuch Images are either to be ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured, or ſuffered to remain, no more than

                        <hi>Ezechias</hi> left the braſen Serpent undeſtroyed, when it was worſhipped, although it were both ſet up by Gods Commandment, and alſo approved by a great and true Miracle; for as many as beheld it, were by and by healed: neither ought Miracles to perſwade us to do contrary to Gods Word.

                        <hi>Thou ſhalt not lay a ſtumbling-block or ſtone before the blind.</hi> But Images in Churches and Temples have been, and be, and (as afterward ſhall be proved) ever will be offences and ſtumbling-blocks, ſpecially to the weak, ſimple, and blind common People, deceiving their hearts by the cunning of the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tificer (as the Scripture expreſly in ſundry places doth teſtifie) and ſo bringing them to Idolatry.<note place="margin">Sap. 13.12.</note>

                     <p>If anſwer be yet made, that this offence may be taken away by diligent and ſincere Doctrine and Preaching of Gods Word, as by other means: and that Images in Churches and Temples therefore be not things abſolutely evil to all men, although dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous to ſome: and therefore that it were to be holden, that the publick having of them in Churches and Temples, is not expedient, as a thing perillous, rather than unlawful, and a thing utterly wicked. Then followeth the third Article to be proved, which is this: That it is not poſſible, if Images be ſuffered in Churches and Temples, either
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:54673:131"/> by preaching of Gods Word, or by any other means, to keep the People from worſhipping of them, and ſo to avoid Idolatry. And firſt, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning Preaching. If it ſhould be admitted, that although Images were ſuffered in Churches, yet might Idolatry by diligent and ſincere preaching of Gods Word be avoided: It ſhould follow of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity, that ſincere Doctrine might always be had and continue, as well as Images, and ſo that where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever, to offence, were exected an Image, there alſo, of reaſon, a godly and ſincere Preacher ſhould and might be continually maintained. For it is reaſon, that the warning be as common as the ſtumbling-block, the remedy as large as is the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, the medicine as general as the poiſon: but that is not poſſible, as both reaſon and experience teacheth.

For our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour Chriſt ſaith, <hi>The harveſt is plentiful, but the workmen be but few:</hi> which hath been hitherto continually true, and will be to the Worlds end: And in our time, and here in our Countrey ſo true, that every Shire ſhould ſcarcely have one good Preacher, if they were divided.</p>
                     <p>Now, Images will continually to the beholders preach their Doctrine, that is, the worſhipping of Images and Idolatry, to the which Preaching man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind is exceeding prone, and inclined to give ear and credit: as experience of all Nations and Ages doth too much prove. But a true Preacher to ſtay this miſchief, is in very many places ſcarcely heard once in a whole year, and ſomewhere not once in ſeven years, as is evident to be proved.
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:54673:131"/> And that evil Opinion which hath been long rooted in mens hearts, cannot ſuddenly by one Sermon be rooted out clean. And as few are inclined to credit ſound Doctrine; as many, and almoſt all, be prone to Superſtition and Idolatry. So that herein appeareth not only a difficulty, but alſo an impoſſibility of the Remedy. Further, it appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth not by any ſtory of credit, that true and ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere Preaching hath endured in any one place above one hundred years: But it is evident that Images, Superſtition, and worſhipping of Images, and Idolatry have continued many hundred years. For all Writings and Experience do teſtifie, that good things do by little and little ever decay, until they be clean baniſhed: and contrariwiſe, evil things do more and more increaſe, till they come to a full perfection of wickedneſs. Neither need we to ſeek examples far off for a proof hereof, our preſent matter is an example. For preaching of Gods Word moſt ſincere (in the beginning) by proceſs of time waxed leſs and leſs pure, and after corrupt, and laſt of all, altogether laid down and left off, and other inventions of men crept in place of it. And on the other part, Images among Chriſtian men were firſt painted, and that in whole ſtories together, which had ſome ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication in them: Afterwards, they were emboſſed, and made of Timber, Stone, Plaiſter, and Metal. And firſt, they were only kept privately in private mens houſes: And then after, they crept into Churches and Temples, but firſt by painting, and after by emboſſing; and yet were they no where at the firſt worſhipped. But ſhortly after, they began to be worſhipped of the ignorant ſort of men, as appeareth by the Epiſtle that <hi>Gregory</hi> the firſt of that name, Biſhop of <hi>Rome,</hi> did write to <hi>Serenus,</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Marſelles.</hi> Of the which two Biſhops, <hi>Serenus</hi> for Idolatry committed to Images, brake them, and burned them. <hi>Gregory,</hi> although be thought it tolerable to let them ſtand, yet he
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:54673:132"/> judged it abominable that they ſhould be worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped, and thought (as is now alledged) that the worſhipping of them might be ſtayed, by teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Gods Word, according as he exhorteth <hi>Serenus</hi> to teach the People, as in the ſame Epiſtle appeareth. But whether <hi>Gregory</hi>'s Opinion, or <hi>Serenus</hi>'s judgment were better herein, conſider ye, I pray you, for Experience by and by confuteth <hi>Gregory</hi>'s Opinion. For notwithſtanding <hi>Gregory</hi>'s writing, and the preaching of others, Images be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing once publickly ſet up in Temples and Churches, ſimple Men and Women ſhortly after fell on heaps to worſhipping of them: And at the laſt, the learned alſo were carried away with the publick Error, as with a violent ſtream or flood. And at the ſecond Council <hi>Nicene,</hi> the Biſhops and Clergy decreed, that Images ſhould be worſhipped: and ſo by occaſion of theſe ſtumbling-blocks, not only the unlearned and ſimple, but the learned and wiſe; not the People only, but the Biſhops; not the Sheep, but alſo the Shepherds themſelves (who ſhould have been guides in the right way, and lights to ſhine in darkneſs) being blinded by the bewitching of Images, as blind guides of the blind, fell both into the Pit of damnable Idolatry. In the which all the World, as it were drowned, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued until our Age, by the ſpace of above eight hundred years, unſpoken againſt in a manner. And this ſucceſs had <hi>Gregory</hi>'s Order, which miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief had never come to paſs, had Biſhop <hi>Serenus</hi> his way been taken, and all Idols and Images been utterly deſtroyed and aboliſhed: for no man wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhippeth that that is not. And thus you ſee, how from having of Images privately, it came to pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick ſetting of them up in Churches and Temples, although without harm at the firſt, as was then of ſome wiſe and learned men judged: and from ſimple having them there, it came at the laſt to worſhipping of them.

<pb n="251" facs="tcp:54673:132"/> danger of Superſtition and Idolatry, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards by the Biſhops, the learned, and by the whole Clergy. So that Laity and Clergy, Learned and Unlearned, all Ages, Sects, and Degrees of Men, Women, and Children, of whole Chriſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom (an horrible and moſt dreadful thing to think) have been at once drowned in abominable Idolatry, of all other vices moſt deteſted of God, and moſt damnable to man, and that by the ſpace of eight hundred years and more. And to this end is come that beginning of ſetting up of Images in Churches, then judged harmleſs, in experience proved not only harmful, but exitious and peſtilent, and to the deſtruction and ſubverſion of all good Religion univerſally. So that I conclude, as it may be poſſible in ſome one City or little Countrey, to have Images ſet up in Temples and Churches, and yet Idolatry by earneſt and continual preaching of Gods true Word, and the ſincere Goſpel of our Saviour Chriſt, may be kept away for a ſhort time: So it is impoſſible, that (Images once ſet up and ſuffered in Temples and Churches) any great Countries, much leſs the whole World, can any long time be kept from Idolatry. And the godly will reſpect, not only their own City, Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey, and Time, and the Health of Men of their Age: but be careful for all places and times, and the Salvation of men of all Ages. At the leaſt, they will not lay ſuch ſtumbling-blocks and ſnares for the feet of other Country-men and Ages, which experience hath already proved to have been the ruine of the World. Wherefore I make a general concluſion of all that I have hitherto ſaid: If the ſtumbling-blocks and poiſons of mens Souls, by ſetting up of Images, will be many, yea, infinite if they be ſuffered, and the warnings of the ſame ſtumbling-blocks, and remedies for the ſaid poiſons by preaching but few, as is already declared: if the ſtumbling-blocks be eaſie to be laid, the poiſons ſoon provided, and the warnings and remedies hard
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:54673:133"/> to know or come by: if the ſtumbling-blocks lie continually in the way, and poiſon be ready at hand every where, and warnings and remedies but ſeldom given: and if all men be more ready of themſelves to ſtumble and be offended, than to be warned, all men more ready to drink of the poiſon, than to taſte of the remedy (as is before partly, and ſhall hereafter more fully be declared) and ſo in fine, the poiſon continually and deeply drunk of many, the remedy ſeldom and faintly taſted of by a few: How can it be but that infinite of the weak and infirm ſhall be offended, infinite by ruine ſhall break their necks, infinite by deadly venom be poiſoned in their ſouls? And how is the charity of God, or love of our Neighbours in our hearts then, if when we may remove ſuch dangerous ſtumbling-blocks, ſuch peſtilent poiſons, we will not remove them? What ſhall I ſay of them which will lay ſtumbling-blocks, where before there was none, and ſet ſnares for the feet, nay, for the ſouls of weak and ſimple ones, and work the danger of their everlaſting deſtruction, for whom our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour Chriſt ſhed his moſt precious Blood, where better it were that the Arts of Painting, Plaiſtering, Carving, Graving, and Founding, had never been found nor uſed, than one of them, whoſe ſouls in the ſight of God are ſo precious, ſhould by occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of Image or Picture, periſh and be loſt. And thus is it declared that preaching cannot poſſibly ſtay Idolatry, if Images be ſet up publickly in Temples and Churches. And as true is it, that no other remedy, as writing againſt Idolatry, Councils aſſembled, Decrees made againſt it, ſevere Laws likewiſe, and Proclamations of Princes and Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perours, neither extream Puniſhments and Penalties, nor any other remedy could or can be poſſibly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſed for the avoiding of Idolatry, if Images be publickly ſet up and ſuffered. For concerning writing againſt Images, and Idolatry to them com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, there hath been alledged unto you in the
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:54673:133"/> Second Part of this Treatiſe a great many places out of <hi>Tertullian, Origen, Lactantius, S. Auguſtine, Epiphanius, S. Ambroſe, Clemens,</hi> and divers other learned and holy Biſhops and Doctors of the Church. And beſides theſe, all Hiſtories Eccleſiaſtical, and Books of other godly and learned Biſhops and Doctors are full of notable examples and ſentences againſt Images and the worſhipping of them. And as they have moſt earneſtly written, ſo did they ſincerely and moſt diligently in their time teach and preach, according to their writings and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples. For they were then preaching Biſhops, and more often ſeen in Pulpits, than in Princes Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laces, more often occupied in his Legacy, who ſaid, <hi>Go ye into the whole world, and preach the Goſpel to all men,</hi> than in Embaſſages and Affairs of Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces in this World. And as they were moſt zealous and diligent, ſo were they of excellent learning and godlineſs of life, and by both of great Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity and Credit with the People, and ſo of more force and likelihood to perſwade the People, and the People more like to believe and follow their Doctrine. But if their Preachings could not help, much leſs could their Writings, which do but come to the knowledge of a few that be learned, in compariſon to continual Preaching, whereof the whole multitude is partaker. Neither did the Old Fathers, Biſhops, and Doctors, ſeverally only by Preaching and Writing, but alſo together, great numbers of them aſſembled in Synods and Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils, make Decrees and Eccleſiaſtical Laws againſt Images, and the worſhipping of them; neither did they ſo once or twice, but divers times, and in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers Ages and Countries, aſſembled Synods and Councils, and made ſevere Decrees againſt Images, and worſhipping of them, as hath been at large in the Second Part of this Homily before declared. But all their Writing, Preaching, aſſembling in Councils, decreeing and making of Laws Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſtical, could nothing help, either to pull down
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:54673:134"/> Images, to whom Idolatry was committed, or againſt Idolatry whilſt Images ſtood. For thoſe blind Books, and dumb School-maſters, I mean Images and Idols (for they call them Lay-mens Books and School-maſters) by their carved and painted Writings, teaching and preaching Idolatry, prevailed againſt all their written Books, and preaching with lively voice, as they call it. Well, if Preaching and Writing could not keep men from worſhipping of Images and Idolatry, if Pen and Words could not do it, you would think that Penalty and Sword might do it; I mean, that Princes by ſevere Laws and Puniſhments might ſtay this unbridled affection of all men to Idolatry, though Images were ſet up and ſuffered. But ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience proveth, that this can no more help againſt Idolatry, than Writing and Preaching. For Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Emperors (whoſe Authority ought of reaſon, and by Gods Law, to be greateſt) above eight in number, and ſix of them ſucceſſively reigning one after another (as is in the Hiſtories before re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hearſed) making moſt ſevere Laws and Proclama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions againſt Idols and Idolatry, Images and the worſhipping of Images; and executing moſt grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous puniſhments, yea, the penalty of Death, upon the maintainers of Images, and upon Idolaters and Image-worſhippers: could not bring to paſs, that either Images once ſet up, might throughly be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed, or that men ſhould refrain from the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipping of them, being ſet up. And what think you then will come to paſs, if men of learning ſhould teach the People to make them, and ſhould maintain the ſetting up of them, as things neceſſary in Religion? To conclude, it appeareth evidently by all ſtories and writings, and experience in times paſt, that neither Preaching, neither Writing, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the conſent of the Learned, nor authority of the Godly, nor the decrees of Councils, neither the Laws of Princes, nor extream puniſhments of the Offenders in that behalf, nor any other remedy or
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:54673:134"/> means, can help againſt Idolatry, if Images be ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered publickly. And it is truly ſaid, that times paſt are School-maſters of Wiſdom to us that fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low and live after. Therefore if in times paſt, the moſt vertuous and beſt learned, the moſt diligent alſo, and in number almoſt infinite, ancient Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, Biſhops, and Doctors with their Writing, Preaching, Induſtry, Earneſtneſs, Authority, Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblies, and Councils could do nothing againſt Images and Idolatry, to Images once ſet up: what can we, neither in learning, nor holineſs of life, neither in diligence, neither in authority, to be compared with them, but men in contempt, and of no eſtimation (as the World goeth now) few alſo in number, in ſo great a multitude and malice of men. What can we do, I ſay, or bring to paſs to the ſtay of Idolatry or worſhipping of Images, if they be allowed to ſtand publickly in Temp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>es and Churches? And if ſo many, ſo mighty Emperors, by ſo ſevere Laws and Proclamations, ſo rigorous and extream Puniſhments and Executions could not ſtay the People from ſetting up and worſhipping of Images: what will enſue, think you, when men ſhall commend them as neceſſary Books of the Lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men? Let us therefore of theſe latter days learn this Leſſon of the Experience of ancient Antiquity, that Idolatry cannot poſſibly be ſeparated from Images any long time: but that as an unſeparable accident, or as a ſhadow followeth the body when the Sun ſhineth, ſo Idolatry followeth and cleaveth to the publick having of Images in Temples and Churches. And finally, as Idolatry is to be ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horred and avoided, ſo are Images (which cannot be long without Idolatry) to be put away and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed. Beſides the which experiments and proof of time before, the very nature and origine of Images themſelves draweth to Idolatry moſt vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently; and mens nature and inclination alſo is bent to Idolatry ſo vehemently, that it is not poſſible to ſever or part Images, nor to keep men from Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry,
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:54673:135"/> if Images be ſuffered publickly. That I ſpeak of the nature and origine of Images, is this: Even as the firſt invention of them is naught, and no good can come of that which had an evil beginning, for they be altogether naught, as <hi>Athanaſius</hi> in his Book againſt the Gentiles declareth; and St. <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rome</hi> alſo upon the Prophet <hi>Jeremy,</hi> the ſixth Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; and <hi>Euſebius</hi> in the Seventh Book of his Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſtical Hiſtory, the xviij. teſtifieth, that as they firſt came from the Gentiles, which were Idolaters and worſhippers of Images, unto us; and as the invention of them was the beginning of Spiritual Fornication, as the Word of God teſtifieth, <hi>Sap.</hi> 14. So will they naturally (as it were of neceſſity) turn to their origine from whence they came, and draw us with them moſt violently to Idolatry, abomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to God and all godly men. For if the origine of Images, and worſhipping of them, as it is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded in the eighth Chapter of the Book of <hi>Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,</hi> began of a blind love of a fond Father, fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming for his comfort an Image of his Son, being dead, and ſo at the laſt men fell to the worſhipping of the Image of him whom they did know to be dead: How much more will Men and Women fall to the worſhipping of the Images of God, our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour Chriſt, and his Saints, if they be ſuffered to ſtand in Churches and Temples publickly? For the greater the opinion is of the Majeſty and Holineſs of the Perſon to whom an Image is made, the ſooner will the People fall to the worſhipping of the ſaid Image. Wherefore the Images God, our Saviour Chriſt, the Bleſſed Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> the Apoſtles, Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs, and others of notable Holineſs, are of all other Images moſt dangerous for the peril of Idolatry, and therefore greateſt heed to be taken that none of them be ſuffered to ſtand publickly in Churches and Temples. For there is no great dread leſt any ſhould fall to the worſhipping of the Images of <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nas, Caiaphas, Pilate,</hi> or <hi>Judas</hi> the Traytor, if they were ſet up. But to the other, it is already at full
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:54673:135"/> proved, that Idolatry hath been, is, and is moſt like continually to be committed. Now, as was before touched, and is here moſt largely to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared, the nature of man is none otherwiſe bent to worſhipping of Images (if he may have them, and ſee them) than it is bent to Whoredom and Adultery in the company of Harlots. And as unto a man given to the luſt of the fleſh, ſeeing a wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton Harlot, ſitting by her, and embracing her, it profiteth little for one to ſay,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 6. 1 Cor. 4. Heb. 13.</note> Beware of Fornica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, God will condemn Fornicators and Adulte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers: for neither will he, being overcome with greater inticements of the Strumpet, give ear or take heed to ſuch godly admonitions; and when he is left afterwards alone with the Harlot, nothing can follow but wickedneſs: even ſo, ſuffer Images to be ſet in the Churches and Temples, ye ſhall in vain bid them beware of Images, as St. <hi>John</hi> doth,<note place="margin">1 John 5.</note> and flee Idolatry as all the Scriptures warn us; ye ſhall in vain preach and teach them againſt Idolatry. For a number will notwithſtanding fall headlong unto it, what by the nature of Images, and what by the inclination of their own corrupt nature.</p>
                     <p>Wherefore as for a man given to Luſt, to ſit down by a Strumpet, is to tempt God; ſo is it likewiſe to erect an Idol in this proneneſs of mans nature to Idolatry, nothing but a tempting. Now, if any will ſay that this ſimilitude proveth nothing; yet I pray them let the Word of God, out of the which the ſimilitude is taken, prove ſomething.<note place="margin">Lev. 17. and 20. Numb. 25. Deut. 31. Baruch 6.</note> Doth not the Word of God call Idolary, ſpiritual Fornica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion? Doth it not call a gilt or painted Idol or Image, a Strumpet with a painted Face? Be not the ſpiritual wickedneſſes of an Idols inticing like the flatteries of a wanton Harlot? Be not Men and Women as prone to ſpiritual Fornication (I mean Idolatry) as to carnal Fornication? If this be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied, let all the Nations upon the Earth which have been Idolaters (as by all ſtories appeareth) prove it true. Let the Jews and the People of God,
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:54673:136"/> which were ſo often and ſo earneſtly warned, ſo dreadfully threatned concerning Images and Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry, and ſo extreamly puniſhed therefore (and yet fell into it) prove it to be true; as in almoſt all the Books of the Old Teſtament, namely, the <hi>Kings</hi> and the <hi>Chronicles,</hi> and the Prophets, it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth moſt evidently. Let all Ages and Times, and Men of all Ages and Times, of all Degrees and Conditions, Wiſe men, Learned men, Princes, Idiots, Unlearned, and Commonalty, prove it to be true. If you require Examples: For Wiſe Men, ye have the <hi>Egyptians,</hi> and the Indian <hi>Gymnoſophiſts;</hi> for wiſeſt men of the World, you have <hi>Solomon</hi> the wiſeſt of all other. For Learned men, the <hi>Greeks,</hi> and namely, the <hi>Athenians,</hi> exceeding all other Nations in Superſtition and Idolatry, as in the Hiſtory of the <hi>Acts</hi> of the Apoſtles St. <hi>Paul</hi> chargeth them.<note place="margin">Acts 17. Rom. 1.</note> For Princes and Governors, you have the <hi>Romans,</hi> the rulers of the roſt (as they ſay) you have the ſame forenamed King <hi>Solomon,</hi> and all the Kings of <hi>Iſrael</hi> and <hi>Judah</hi> after him, ſaving <hi>David, Ezechias,</hi> and <hi>Joſias,</hi> and one or two more. All theſe (I ſay) and infinite others, wiſe, learned Princes and Governors, being all Idolaters, have you for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples and a proof of mens inclination to Idolatry. That I may paſs over with ſilence in the mean time, infinite multitudes and millions of Idiots and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>learned,<note place="margin">Pſal. 23.</note> the ignorant and groſs People, <hi>like unto Horſes and Mules, in whom is no underſtanding,</hi> whoſe peril and danger to fall on heaps to Idolatry by occaſion of Images,<note place="margin">Sap. 13.14.</note> the Scriptures ſpecially fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhew and give warning of. And indeed how ſhould the unlearned, ſimple, and fooliſh ſcape the Nets and Snares of Idols and Images, in the which the wiſeſt and the beſt learned have been ſo entangled, trapped, and wrapped? Wherefore the Argument holdeth this ground ſure, That men be as inclined of their corrupt Nature to ſpiritual Fornication, as to carnal; which the wiſdom of God fore-ſeeing, to the general prohibition, <hi>that none ſhould make
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:54673:136"/> to themſelves any Image or ſimilitude,</hi> addeth a cauſe, depending of mans corrupt Nature. <hi>Leſt</hi> (ſaith God) <hi>thou being deceived with error,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Deut. 4.</note> 
                        <hi>honour and worſhip them.</hi> And of this ground of mans corrupt inclination, as well to ſpiritual Fornication, as to carnal, it muſt needs follow, That as it is the duty of the godly Magiſtrate, loving Honeſty, and hating Whoredom, to remove all Strumpets and Harlots, ſpecially out of places notoriouſly ſuſpected, or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſorted unto of naughty packs, for the avoiding of carnal Fornication: ſo it is the duty of the ſame godly Magiſtrate, after the examples of the godly Kings, <hi>Ezechias</hi> and <hi>Joſias,</hi> to drive away all ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Harlots (I mean Idols and Images) eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally out of ſuſpected places, Churches and Temples, dangerous for Idolatry to be committed to Images placed there, as it were in the appointed place and height of Honour and Worſhip (as St. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> ſaith) where the living God only (and not dead ſtones and ſtocks) is to be worſhipped:<note place="margin">Auguſtin. in <hi>Pſal. 36.</hi> &amp; <hi>113.</hi> &amp; lib. <hi>4.</hi> cap. <hi>3.</hi> de civit. Dei.</note> It is (I ſay) the office of godly Magiſtrates likewiſe to avoid Images and Idols out of Churches and Temples, as ſpiritual Harlots out of ſuſpected pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces for the avoiding of Idolatry, which is ſpiritual Fornication. And as he were the Enemy of all Honeſty, that ſhould bring Strumpets and Harlots out of their ſecret corners into the Publick Market-place, there freely to dwell and practice their filthy Merchandiſe: So is he the Enemy of the true wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipping of God, that bringeth Idols and Images into the Temple and Church, the Houſe of God, there openly to be worſhipped, and to rob the zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous God of his Honour, who will not give it to any other, nor his Glory to carved Images, who is as much forſaken, and the bond of love between man and him as much broken by Idolatry, which is ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Fornication, as is the knot and bond of Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage broken by carnal Fornication. Let all this be taken as a lie, if the Word of God enforce it not to be true.<note place="margin">Deut. 27.</note> 
                        <hi>Curſed be the man</hi> (ſaith God in
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:54673:137"/> 
                        <hi>Deuteronomy) that maketh a carved or molten Image, and placeth it in a ſecret corner: and all the people ſhall ſay, Amen.</hi> Thus ſaith God, for at that time no man durſt have or worſhip Images openly, but in corners only: and the whole World being the great Temple of God, he that in any corner thereof robbeth God of his glory, and giveth it to ſtocks and ſtones, is pronounced by Gods Word accurſed. Now, he that will bring theſe ſpiritual Harlots out of their lurking corners, into publick Churches and Temples, that ſpiritual Fornication may there openly of all Men and Women without ſhame be committed with them, no doubt that Perſon is curſed of God, and twice curſed, and all good and godly Men and Women will ſay, <hi>Amen,</hi> and their Amen will take effect alſo. Yea, and furthermore the madneſs of all men profeſſing the Religion of Chriſt, now by the ſpace of a ſort of hundred years, and yet even in our time in ſo great light of the Goſpel, very many running on heaps by Sea and Land, to the great loſs of their time, expence and waſte of their Goods, deſtitution of their Wives, Children, and Families, and danger of their own Bodies and Lives, to <hi>Compoſtella, Rome, Jeruſalem,</hi> and other far Countries, to viſit dumb and dead ſtocks and ſtones, doth ſufficiently prove the proneneſs of mans corrupt nature to the ſeeking of Idols once ſet up, and the worſhipping of them. And thus as well by the origine and nature of Idols and Images themſelves, as by the proneneſs and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination of mans corrupt nature to Idolatry, it is evident, that neither Images, if they be publickly ſet up, can be ſeparated, nor men, if they ſee Images in Temples and Churches, can be ſlaid and kept from Idolatry. Now, whereas they yet alledge, that howſoever the People, Princes, Learned, and Wiſe, of Old time, have fallen into Idolatry by occaſion of Images, that yet in our time the moſt part, ſpecially the learned and wiſe, of any Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, take no hurt nor offence by Idols and Images,
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:54673:137"/> neither do run into far Countries to them, and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip them: And that they know well what an Idol or Image is, and how to be uſed, and that therefore it followeth, Images in Churches and Temples to be an indifferent thing, as the which of ſome is not abuſed; and that therefore they may juſtly hold (as was in the beginning of this part by them al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged) that it is not unlawful or wicked abſolutely to have Images in Churches and Temples, though it may for the danger of the ſimple ſort ſeem to be not altogether expedient.</p>
                     <p>Whereunto may be well replyed, that <hi>Solomon</hi> alſo, the wiſeſt of all men, did well know what an Idol or Image was, neither took any harm thereof a great while himſelf, and alſo with his godly wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings armed others againſt the danger of them. But yet afterward the ſame <hi>Solomon</hi> ſuffering his wanton Paramours to bring their Idols into his Court and Palace, was by carnal Harlots perſwaded,<note place="margin">Sap. 13.14.</note> and brought at the laſt to the committing of Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Fornication with Idols, and of the wiſeſt and godlieſt Prince, became the moſt fooliſh and wicked alſo. Wherefore it is better even for the wiſeſt to regard this warning, <hi>He that loveth danger,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Eccl. 3. and 13. 1 Cor. 10.</note> 
                        <hi>ſhall periſh therein:</hi> and <hi>Let him that ſtandeth beware leſt he fall,</hi> rather than wittingly and willingly to lay ſuch a ſtumbling-block for his own feet and others, that may perhaps bring him at laſt to break neck. The good King <hi>Ezechias</hi> did know well enough,<note place="margin">4 Reg. 18.</note> that the braſen Serpent was but a dead Image, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he took no hurt himſelf thereby through Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry to it: Did he therefore let it ſtand, becauſe himſelf took no hurt thereof? No, not ſo: but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a good King, and therefore regarding the health of his ſilly Subjects, deceived by that Image, and committing Idolatry thereto, he did not only take it down, but alſo brake it to pieces; and this he did to that Image that was ſet up by the Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of God, in the preſence whereof great Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles were wrought, as that which was a figure of our
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:54673:138"/> Saviour Chriſt to come, who ſhould deliver us from the mortal ſting of the Old Serpent, Satan. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther did he ſpare it in reſpect of the ancientneſs or antiquity of it, which had continued above ſeven hundred years; nor for that it had been ſuffered, and preſerved by ſo many godly Kings before his time. How (think you) would that godly Prince (if he were now living) handle our Idols, ſet up againſt Gods Commandment directly, and being figures of nothing but folly, and for Fools to gaze on, till they become as wiſe as the blocks them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves which they ſtare on, and ſo fall down as dared Larks in that gaze, and being themſelves alive, worſhip a dead ſtock or ſtone, gold or ſilver, and ſo become Idolaters, abominable and curſed before the living God, giving the honour due unto him which made them when they were nothing, and to our Saviour Chriſt, who redeemed them being loſt, to the dead and dumb Idol, the work of mans hand, which never did, nor can do any thing for them; no, is not able to ſtir, nor once to move, and therefore worſe than a vile Worm which can move and creep? The excellent King <hi>Joſias</hi> alſo did take himſelf no hurt of Images and Idols, for he did know well what they were: did he there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, becauſe of his own knowledge, let Idols and Images ſtand? much leſs did he ſet any up: Or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther did he not by his knowledge and authority alſo ſuccour the ignorance of ſuch as did not know what they were, by utter taking away of all ſuch ſtum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling-blocks as might be occaſion of ruine to his People and Subjects? Will they, becauſe a few took no hurt by Images or Idols, break the General Law of God, <hi>Thou ſhalt make to thee no ſimilitude,</hi> &amp;c? They might as well, becauſe <hi>Moſes</hi> was not ſeduced by <hi>Jethro</hi>'s Daughter, nor <hi>Boaz</hi> by <hi>Ruth,</hi> being ſtrangers, reaſon, that all the Jews might break the general Law of God, forbidding his People to joyn their Children in Marriage with ſtrangers, leſt they ſeduce their Children that they ſhould not
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:54673:138"/> follow God. Wherefore they which thus reaſon, though it be not expedient, yet it is lawful to have Images publickly, and do prove that lawfulneſs by a few picked and choſen men: if they object that indifferently to all men, which a very few can have without hurt and offence, they ſeem to take the mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude for vile ſouls (as he ſaith in <hi>Virgil</hi>) of whoſe loſs and ſafeguard no reputation is to be had, for whom yet Chriſt paid as dearly as for the mightieſt Prince, or the wiſeſt and beſt learned in the Earth. And they that will have it generally to be taken for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different, that a very few take no hurt of it, though infinite multitudes beſides periſh thereby, ſhew that they put little difference between the multitudes of Chriſtians and brute Beaſts, whoſe danger they do ſo little eſteem. Beſides this, if they be Biſhops or Parſons, or otherwiſe having charge of mens Conſciences that thus reaſon, <hi>It is lawful to have Images publickly, though it be not expedient;</hi> what manner of Paſtors ſhew they themſelves to be to their Flock, which thruſt unto them that which they themſelves confeſs not to be expedient for them, but to the utter mine of the ſouls committed to their charge, for whom they ſhall give a ſtrict account before the Prince of Paſtors at the laſt day? For indeed to object to the weak, and ready to fall of themſelves, ſuch ſtumbling-blocks, is a thing not only not expedient, but unlawful, yea, and moſt wicked alſo. Wherefore it is to be wondred how they can call Images, ſet up in Churches and Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples to no profit or benefit of any, and to ſo great peril and danger, yea, hurt and deſtruction of many, or rather infinite, things indifferent. Is not the publick ſetting up of them rather a ſnare for all men, and the tempting of God? I beſeech theſe reaſoners to call to mind their own accuſtomed Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance and Decree, whereby they determined that the Scripture, though by God himſelf com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded to be known of all Men, Women, and Children, ſhould not be read of the ſimple, nor had
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:54673:139"/> in the vulgar Tongue, for that (as they ſaid) it was dangerous, by bringing the ſimple People into Errors.<note place="margin">Deut. 31.</note> And will they not forbid Images to be ſet up in Churches and Temples, which are not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded, but forbidden moſt ſtrictly by God, but let them ſtill be there, yea, and maintain them alſo, ſeeing the People are brought, not into danger only, but indeed into moſt abominable Errors and deteſtable Idolatry thereby? Shall Gods Word, by God commanded to be read unto all, and known of all, for danger of Hereſie (as they ſay) be ſhut up? and Idols and Images, notwithſtanding they be forbidden by God, and notwithſtanding the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of Idolatry by them, ſhall they yet be ſet up, ſuffered, and maintained in Churches and Temples? O worldly and fleſhly wiſdom, even bent to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain the inventions and traditions of men by carnal Reaſon, and by the ſame to diſanul or deface the Holy Ordinances, Laws, and Honour of the Eternal God, who is to be honoured and praiſed for ever. <hi>Amen.</hi>

So that Chriſtians were then driven to dwell in Caves and Dens: ſo far off was it that they had any publick Temples adorned and decked as they now be, which is here rehearſed to the confutation of thoſe, which report ſuch glorious gloſſed Fables of the goodly and gorgeous Temple, that St. <hi>Peter, Linus, Cletus,</hi> and thoſe thirty Biſhops their Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſors had at <hi>Rome,</hi> until the time of the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror <hi>Conſtantine,</hi> and which St. <hi>Policarp</hi> ſhould have in <hi>Aſia,</hi> or <hi>Irenaeus</hi> in <hi>France,</hi> by ſuch lies, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to all true Hiſtories, to maintain the ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluous gilding and decking of Temples now adays, wherein they put almoſt the whole ſum and pith of our Religion.

But although <hi>Conſtantine,</hi> and other Princes, of good zeal to our Religion, did ſumptuouſly deck and adorn Chriſtians Temples, yet did they dedicate at that time all Churches and Temples to God, or our Saviour Chriſt, and to no Saint,<note place="margin">Novel. con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtit. <hi>3.</hi> &amp; <hi>47.</hi>
                        </note> for that abuſe began long after in <hi>Juſtinian</hi>'s time.

Let St. <hi>Jerome</hi> (although otherwiſe too great a liker and allower of external and outward things) be a proof hereof, who hath theſe words in his Epiſtle to <hi>Demetriades, Let others</hi> (ſaith St. <hi>Jerome) build Churches, cover Walls with Tables of Marble, carry together huge Pillars, and gild their tops or heads, which do not feel or underſtand their precious decking and adorning; let them deck the doors with Ivory and Silver, and ſet the golden Altars with precious ſtones, I blame it not; let every man abound in his own ſenſe, and better is it ſo to do, than care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully to keep their Riches laid up in ſtore. But thou
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:54673:140"/> haſt another way appointed thee, to clothe Chriſt in the Poor, to viſit him in the ſick, ſeed him in the hungry, lodge him in thoſe who do lack harbour, and eſpecially ſuch as be of the houſhold of Faith.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And the ſame St. <hi>Jerome,</hi> toucheth the ſame mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſomewhat more freely in his Treatiſe of the Life of Clerks to <hi>Nepotian,</hi> ſaying thus, <hi>Many build Walls, and erect Pillars of Churches, the ſmooth Marbles do gliſter, the Roof ſhineth with Gold, the Altar is ſet with precious Stones: But of the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters of Chriſt, there is no election or choice. Neither let any man object and alledge againſt me the rich Temple that was in</hi> Jewry, <hi>the Table, Candleſticks, Incenſe, Ships, Platters, Cups, Mortars, and other things all of Gold. Then were theſe things allowed of the Lord, when the Prieſts offered Sacrifices, and the blood of Beaſts was accounted the redemption of ſins. Howbeit, all theſe things went before in figure; and they were written for us, upon whom the end of the World is come. And now when that our Lord being poor, hath dedicated the poverty of his Houſe, let us remember his Croſs, and we ſhall eſteem Riches as Mire and Dung. What do we marvel at that which Chriſt calleth wicked Mammon? Whereto we do ſo highly eſteem and love that which St.</hi> Peter <hi>doth for a glory teſtifie that he had not?</hi> Hitherto St. <hi>Jerome.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Thus you ſee how St. <hi>Jerome</hi> teacheth the ſumptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs amongſt the Jews to be a figure to ſignifie, and not an example to follow; and that thoſe out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward things were ſuffered for a time, until Chriſt our Lord came, who turned all thoſe outward things into Spirit, Faith, and Truth. And the ſame St. <hi>Jerome</hi> upon the ſeventh Chapter of <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remy,</hi> ſaith, <hi>God commandeth both the Jews at that time; and now us who are placed in the Church, that we have no truſt in the goodlineſs of Building and gilt Roofs, and in Walls covered with Tables of Marble, and ſay,</hi> The Temple of the Lord, the Temple of the Lord. <hi>For that is the Temple of the
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:54673:141"/> Lord, wherein dwelleth true Faith, godly Converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and the company of all Vertues.</hi> And upon the Prophet <hi>Agge,</hi> he deſcribeth the true and right decking or ornaments of the Temple after this ſort: <hi>I</hi> (ſaith St. <hi>Jerome) do think the Silver wherewith the Houſe of God is decked, to be the Doctrine of the Scriptures, of the which it is ſpoken,</hi> The Doctrine of the Lord is a pure Doctrine, Silver tried in the fire, purged from droſs, puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied ſeven times. And I do take Gold to be that which remaineth in the hid ſenſe of the Saints and the ſecret of the heart, and ſhineth with the true light of God. <hi>Which is evident that the Apoſtle alſo meant of the Saints that build upon the Foundation of Chriſt, ſome Silver, ſome Gold, ſome precious Stones: that by the Gold, the hid ſenſe; by Silver, godly ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terance; by precious Stones, works which pleaſe God, might be ſignified. With theſe Metals, the Church of our Saviour is made more goodly and gorgeous, than was the Synagogue in old time. With theſe lively ſtones, is the Church and Houſe of Chriſt builded, and Peace is given to it for ever.</hi> All theſe be St. <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rome</hi>'s ſayings. No more did the old godly Biſhops and Doctors of the Church allow the over-ſumptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Furniture of Temples and Churches, with Plate, Veſſels of Gold, Silver, and precious Veſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.

                     <p>Now, concerning exceſſive decking of Images and Idols, with Painting, gilding, adorning, with precious Veſtures, Pearl, and Stone, what is it elſe, but for the further povocation and enticement to ſpiritual Fornication, to deck ſpiritual Harlots moſt
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:54673:142"/> coſtly and wantonly, which the Idolatrous Church underſtandeth well enough. For ſhe being indeed not only an Harlot (as the Scripture calleth her) but alſo a foul, filthy, old, withered Harlot (for ſhe is indeed of ancient years) and underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing her lack of natural and true Beauty, and great loathſomneſs which of her ſelf ſhe hath, doth (after the cuſtom of ſuch Harlots) paint her ſelf, and deck and tire her ſelf with Gold, Pearl, Stone, and all kind of precious Jewels, that ſhe ſhining with the outward beauty and glory of them, may pleaſe the fooliſh phantaſie of fond Lovers, and ſo entice them to ſpiritual Fornication with her. Who, if they ſaw her (I will not ſay naked) but in ſimple Apparel, would abhor her, as the fouleſt and filthieſt Harlot that ever was ſeen: According as appeareth by the deſcription of the garniſhing of the great Strumpet of all ſtrumpets, the Mother of Whoredom,<note place="margin">Apoc. 17.</note> ſet forth by St. <hi>John</hi> in his <hi>Revelation,</hi> who by her glory provoked the Princes of the Earth to commit Whoredom with her. Whereas on the contrary part, the true Church of God, as a chaſte Matron, eſpouſed (as the Scripture teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth) to one Husband, our Saviour Jeſus Chriſt, whom alone ſhe is content only to pleaſe and ſerve, and looketh not to delight the eyes or phantaſies of any other ſtrange Lovers or Wooers, is content with her natural Ornaments, not doubting, by ſuch ſincere ſimplicity beſt to pleaſe him, who can well skill of the difference between a painted Viſage, and true natural Beauty. And concerning ſuch glorious gildings and decking of Images, both Gods Word, written in the tenth Chapter of the Prophet <hi>Jeremy,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Jer. 10.</note> and St. <hi>Hierom</hi>'s Commentaries upon the ſame, are moſt worthy to be noted. Firſt, the words of the Scripture be theſe, <hi>The work-man with his Ax hewed the timber out of the wood with the work of his hands, he decked it with gold and ſilver, he joyned it with nails and pins, and the ſtroke of an hammer, that it might hold together.
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:54673:142"/> They be made ſmooth as the Palm, and they cannot ſpeak: if they be born they remove, for they cannot go. Fear ye them not, for they can neither do evil nor good:</hi> Thus ſaith the Prophet. Upon which Text, St. <hi>Hierome</hi> hath theſe words, <hi>This is the deſcription of Idols, which the Gentiles worſhip, their matter is vile and corruptible. And whereas the Artificer is mortal, the things he maketh muſt needs be corruptible: he decketh it with Silver and Gold, that with the glittering or ſhining of both Metals, he may deceive the ſimple. Which Error indeed hath paſſed over from the Gentiles, that we ſhould judge Religion to ſtand in Riches.</hi> And by and by after he ſaith, <hi>They have the beauty of Metals, and be beautified by the Art of Painting, but good or profit is there none in them.</hi> And ſhortly after again, <hi>They make great promiſes, and deviſe an Image of vain worſhipping of their own phantaſies, they make great brags to deceive every ſimple body, they dull and amaze the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtanding of the unlearned, as it were with golden ſentences, and eloquence, ſhining with the brightneſs of Silver. And of their own deviſers and makers are theſe Images advanced and magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, in the which is no utility nor profit at all, and the worſhipping of the which properly pertaineth to the Gentiles and Heathen, and ſuch as know not God.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Thus far of St. <hi>Jerome</hi>'s words. Whereupon you may note as well his judgment of Images them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, as alſo of the painting, gilding, and deck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of them: that it is an Error which came from the Gentiles, that it perſwadeth Religion to remain in Riches, that it amazeth and deceiveth the ſimple and unlearned with golden ſentences, and ſilver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhining eloquence, and that it appertaineth pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly to the Gentiles and Heathens, and ſuch as know not God. Wherefore the having, painting, gilding, and decking of Images, by St. <hi>Jerome</hi>'s judgment, is erroneous, ſeducing, and bringing into Error (ſpecially the ſimple and unlearned)
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:54673:143"/> heatheniſh, and void of the knowledge of God.</p>
                     <p>Surely the Prophet <hi>Daniel</hi> in the eleventh Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, declareth ſuch ſumptuous decking of Images with Gold, Silver, and precious Stones, to be a token of Antichriſts Kingdom, who (as the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet fore-ſheweth) ſhall worſhip God with ſuch gorgeous things. Now uſually ſuch exceſſive adorn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and decking of Images, hath riſen and been maintained, either of Offerings provoked by Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtition and given in Idolatry, or of Spoils, Robberies, Uſury, or Goods otherwiſe unjuſtly gotten, whereof wicked men have given part to the Images or Saints (as they call them) that they might be pardoned of the whole: as of divers Writings and old Monuments concerning the cauſe and end of certain great gifts, may well appear. And indeed ſuch Mony ſo wickedly gotten, is moſt meet to be put to ſo wicked a uſe. And that which they take to be amends for the whole before God, is more abominable in his ſight, than both the wicked getting, and the more wicked ſpending of all the reſt. For how the Lord alloweth ſuch gifts, he declareth evidently in the Prophet <hi>Iſaiah,</hi> ſaying, <hi>I</hi> (ſaith the Lord) <hi>do love judgment, and I hate ſpoil and raveny offered in Sacrifice:</hi> which the very Gentiles underſtood.<note place="margin">Dialog. de legib. <hi>10.</hi>
                        </note> For <hi>Plato</hi> ſheweth, That ſuch men as ſuppoſe that God doth pardon wicked men, if they give part of their ſpoils and rapine to him, take him to be like a Dog, that would be entreated and hired with part of the Prey, to ſuffer the Wolves to worry the Sheep. And in caſe the Goods wherewith Images be decked, were juſtly gotten,<note place="margin">Lib. <hi>2.</hi> inſt. cap. <hi>4.</hi>
                        </note> yet it is extream madneſs, ſo fooliſhly and wickedly to beſtow Goods purchaſed by Wiſdom and Truth. Of ſuch lewdneſs <hi>Lactantius</hi> writeth thus, <hi>Men do in vain deck Images of the gods with Gold, Ivory, and precious Stone, as though they could take any pleaſure in thoſe things. For what uſe have they of precious Gifts, which underſtand nor feel nothing? Even the ſame that dead men have. For
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:54673:143"/> with like reaſon do they bury dead bodies, farced with Spices and Odours, and clothed with precious Veſtures, and deck Images, which neither felt nor knew when they were made, nor underſtand when they be honoured, for they get no ſenſe and underſtanding by their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecration.</hi> Thus far <hi>Lactantius,</hi> and much more, too long here to rehearſe, declaring, that as little Girls play with little Puppets, ſo be theſe decked Images, great Puppets for Old Fools to play with. And that we may know what, not only men of our Religion, but Ethnicks alſo, judge of ſuch decking of dead Images, it is not unprofitable to hear what <hi>Seneca,</hi> a wiſe and excellent learned Senator of <hi>Rome,</hi> and Philoſopher, ſaith concerning the fooliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of ancient and grave men, uſed in his time in worſhipping and decking of Images: <hi>We</hi> (ſaith <hi>Seneca) be not twice Children (as the common ſaying is) but always Children: but this is the difference, that we being elder, play the Children: and in theſe Plays they bring in before great and well decked Pup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pets (for ſo he calleth Images) Ointments, Incenſe, and Odours. To theſe Puppets they offer up Sacrifice, which have a Mouth, but not the uſe of Teeth. <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>pon theſe they put attiring and precious Apparel, which have no uſe of Clothes. To theſe they give Gold and Silver, which they who receive it (meaning the Images) lack, as well as they that have given it from them.</hi> And <hi>Seneca</hi> much commendeth <hi>Diony<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſius,</hi> King of <hi>Sicily,</hi> for his merry robbing of ſuch decked and jewelled Puppets. But you will ask, what doth this appertain to our Images, which is written againſt the Idols of the Gentiles? Altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſurely. For what uſe or pleaſure have our Images of their decking and precious Ornaments? Did our Images underſtand when they were made? or know, when they be ſo trimmed and decked? Be not theſe things beſtowed upon them, as much in vain, as upon dead men which have no ſenſe? Wherefore it followeth, that there is like fooliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and lewdneſs in decking of our Images as
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:54673:144"/> great Puppets for old Fools, like Children, to play the wicked play of Idolatry, as was before among the Ethnicks and Gentiles. Our Churches ſtand full of ſuch great Puppets, wondrouſly decked and adorned; Garlands and Coronets be ſet on their heads, precious Pearls hanging about their necks, their fingers ſhine with Rings, ſet with pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Stones, their dead and ſtiff bodies are clothed with Garments ſtiff with Gold. You would be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that the Images of our Men-ſaints were ſome Princes of <hi>Perſia</hi> Land with their proud Apparel, and the Idols of our Women-ſaints, were nice and well-trimmed Harlots, tempting their Paramours to wantonneſs: whereby the Saints of God are not honoured, but moſt diſhonoured, and their god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs, ſoberneſs, chaſtity, contempt of riches, and of the vanity of the World, defaced and brought in doubt by ſuch monſtrous decking, moſt differing from their ſober and godly lives.

And with a ſolemn pace they paſs forth before theſe golden Puppets, and fall down to the ground on their Marrow-bones before theſe ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable Idols, and then riſing up again, offer up Odours and Incenſe unto them, to give the People an example of double Idolatry, by worſhipping not only the Idol, but the Gold alſo, and Riches wherewith it is garniſhed. Which things, the moſt part of our Old Martyrs, rather than they would do, or once kneel, or offer up one crumb of Incenſe before an Image, ſuffered moſt cruel and terrible deaths, as the Hiſtories of them at large do declare.

For after that our Preachers ſhall have inſtructed and exhorted the People to the following of the vertues of the Saints, as contempt of this World, Poverty, Soberneſs, Chaſtity, and ſuch like vertues, which undoubtedly were in the Saints: Think you, as ſoon as they turn their faces from the Preacher, and look upon the graven Books, and painted Scripture of the glorious gilt Images and Idols, all ſhining and glittering with Metal and Stone, and covered with precious Veſtures, or elſe with <hi>Choerea</hi> in <hi>Terence,</hi> behold a painted Table, wherein is ſet forth by the Art of the Painter, an Image with a nice and wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton Apparel and Countenance, more like to <hi>Venus</hi> or <hi>Flora,</hi> than <hi>Mary Magdalen,</hi> or if like to <hi>Mary Magdalen,</hi> it is when ſhe played the Harlot, rather than when ſhe wept for her ſins.

But away for ſhame with theſe coloured cloaks of Idolatry, of the Books and Scriptures of Images and Pictures, to teach Idiots, nay, to make Idiots and ſtark Fools and Beaſts of Chriſtians. Do men, I pray you, when they have the ſame Books at home with them, run on Pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grimage to ſeek like Books at <hi>Rome, Compoſtella,</hi> or <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> to be taught by them, when they have the like to learn at home? Do men reverence ſome Books, and deſpiſe and ſet light by other of the ſame ſort? Do men kneel before their Books, light Candles at Noon-time, burn Incenſe, offer up Gold and Silver, and other Gifts to their Books? Do men either feign or believe Miracles to be wrought by their Books? I am ſure that the New Teſtament of our Saviour Jeſus Chriſt, containing the Word of Life, is a more lively, expreſs, and true Image of our Saviour, than all carved, graven, molten, and painted Images in the World be, and yet none of all theſe things be done to that Book or Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the Goſpel of our Saviour, which be done to Images or Pictures, the Books and Scriptures of Lay-men and Idiots, as they call them. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore call them what they liſt, it is moſt evident by their deeds, that they make of them no other Books nor Scripture, than ſuch as teach moſt filthy and horrible Idolatry, as the uſers of ſuch Books daily prove by continual practiſing the ſame. O Books and Scriptures, in the which the deviliſh School-maſter, Satan, hath penned the lewd Leſſons of wicked Idolatry, for his daſtardly Diſciples and
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:54673:145"/> Scholars to behold, read, and learn, to Gods moſt high diſhonour, and their moſt horrible Damnation. Have not we been much bound, think you, to thoſe which ſhould have taught us the truth out of Gods Book and his Holy Scripture, that they have ſhut up that Book and Scripture from us, and none of us ſo bold as once to open it, or read in it? and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead thereof, to ſpread us abroad theſe goodly, carved, and gilded Books and painted Scriptures, to teach us ſuch good and godly Leſſons? Have not they done well, after they ceaſed to ſtand in Pulpits themſelves, and to teach the People committed to their inſtruction, keeping ſilence of Gods Word, and become dumb Dogs (as the Prophet calleth them) to ſet up in their ſtead, on every pillar and corner of the Church, ſuch goodly Doctors, as dumb, but more wicked than themſelves be? We need not to complain of the lack of one dumb Parſon, having ſo many dumb deviliſh Vicars (I mean theſe Idols and painted Puppets) to teach in their ſtead. Now in the mean ſeaſon, whilſt the dumb and dead Idols ſtand thus decked and cloathed, contrary to Gods Law and Commandment, the poor Chriſtian People, the lively Images of God, commended to us ſo tenderly by our Saviour Chriſt, as moſt dear to him, ſtand naked, ſhivering for cold, and their Teeth chattering in their heads, and no man covereth them, are pined with Hunger and Thirſt, and no man giveth them a penny to refreſh them, whereas pounds be ready at all times (con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to Gods will) to deck and trim dead ſtocks and ſtones, which neither feel Cold, Hunger, nor Thirſt.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Clemens</hi> hath a notable ſentence concerning this matter, ſaying thus: <hi>That Serpent the Devil, doth by the mouth of certain men utter theſe words,</hi> We for the honour of the inviſible God, do worſhip viſible Images: <hi>which doubtleſs is moſt falſe. For if you will truly honour the Image of God, you ſhall by doing well to man, honour the true Image of God,
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:54673:146"/> in him. For the Image of God is in every man: But the likeneſs of God is not in every one, but in thoſe only which have a godly Heart and pure Mind. If you will therefore truly honour the Image of God, we do declare to you the truth, that ye do well to man, who is made after the Image of God, that you give honour and reverence to him, and refreſh the hungry with meat, the thirſty with drink, the naked with clothes, the ſick with attendance, the ſtranger har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourleſs with lodging, the Priſoners with neceſſaries: and this ſhall be accounted as truly beſtowed upon God. And theſe things are ſo directly appertaining to Gods Honour, that whoſoever doth not this, ſhall ſeem to have reproached and done villany to the Image of God. For what honour of God is this, to run to Images of ſtock and ſtone, and to honour vain and dead figures of God, and to deſpiſe man, in whom is the true Image of God?</hi> And by and by after, he ſaith, <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtand ye therefore that this is the ſuggeſtion of the Serpent Satan, lurking within you, which perſwadeth you that you are godly, when you honour inſenſible and dead Images, and that you be not ungodly, when you hurt or leave unſuccoured the lively and reaſonable Creatures.</hi> All theſe be the words of <hi>Clemens.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Note, I pray you, how this moſt ancient and learned Doctor, within one hundred years of our Saviour Chriſts time, moſt plainly teacheth, that no ſervice of God, or Religion acceptable to him, can be in honouring of dead Images; but in ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couring of the Poor, the lively Images of God, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to St. <hi>James,</hi> who ſaith, <hi>This is the pure and true Religion before God the Father, to ſuccour fatherleſs and motherleſs Children, and Widows in their affliction, and to keep himſelf undefiled from this World.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>True Religion then, and pleaſing of God, ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth not in making, ſetting up, painting, gilding, clothing, and decking of dumb and dead Images (which be but great Puppets and Babies for Old Fools in dotage, and wicked Idolatry, to dally and
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:54673:146"/> play with) nor in kiſſing of them, capping, kneel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, offering to them, incenſing of them, ſetting up of Candles, hanging up of Legs, Arms, or whole Bodies of Wax before them, or praying, and ask<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of them, or of Saints, things belonging only to God to give. But all theſe things be vain and abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minable, and moſt damnable before God. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore all ſuch do not only beſtow their mony and labour in vain; but with their pains and coſt pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe to themſelves Gods wrath and utter indigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and everlaſting damnation both of Body and Soul. For ye have heard it evidently proved in theſe Homilies againſt Idolatry, by Gods Word, the Doctors of the Church, Eccleſiaſtical Hiſtories, Reaſon, and Experience, that Images have been and be Worſhipped, and ſo Idolatry committed to them by infinite multitudes, to the great offence of Gods Majeſty, and the danger of infinite Souls, and that Idolatry cannot poſſibly be ſeparated from Images ſet up in Churches and Temples, gilded and decked gloriouſly, and that therefore our Images be indeed very Idols, and ſo all the Prohibitions, Laws, Curſes, Threatnings of horrible Plagues, as well temporal as eternal, contained in the Holy Scripture, concerning Idols, and the Makers and Maintainers, and Worſhippers of them, appertain alſo to our Images ſet up in Churches and Temples, and to the Makers, Maintainers, and Worſhippers of them. And all thoſe names of abomination, which Gods Word in the Holy Scriptures giveth to the Idols of the Gentiles, appertain to our Images, being Idols like to them, and having like Idolatry committed unto them. And Gods own mouth in the Holy Scriptures calleth them Vanities, Lies, Deceits, Uncleanneſs, Filthineſs, Dung, Miſchief, and Abomination before the Lord. Wherefore Gods horrible wrath, and our moſt dreadful danger cannot be avoided, without the deſtruction and utter aboliſhing of all Images and Idols our of the Church and Temple of God, which to accompliſh,
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:54673:147"/> God put in the minds of all Chriſtian Princes. And in the mean time, let us take heed and be wiſe, O ye beloved of the Lord, and let us have no ſtrange gods, but one only God, who made us when we were nothing, the Father of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt,<note place="margin">John 17.</note> who redeemed us when we were loſt, and with his Holy Spirit doth ſanctifie us. For this is life everlaſting, to know him to be the only true God, and Jeſus Chriſt, whom he hath ſent. Let us honour and worſhip for Religions ſake none but him, and him let us worſhip and honour as he will himſelf, and hath declared by his Word, that he will be honoured and worſhipped, not in, nor by Images or Idols, which he hath moſt ſtrictly for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden, neither in kneeling, lighting of Candles, burning of Incenſe, offering up of Gifts unto Images and Idols, to believe that we ſhall pleaſe him, for all theſe be abomination before God: But let us ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and worſhip God in Spirit and in Truth,<note place="margin">John 4.</note> fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and loving him above all things, truſting in him only, calling upon him, and praying to him only, praiſing and lauding of him only, and all other in him, and for him. For ſuch worſhippers doth our Heavenly Father love, who is a moſt pure Spirit, and therefore will be worſhipped in Spirit and in Truth. And ſuch worſhippers were <hi>Abraham, Moſes, David, Elias, Peter, Paul, John,</hi> and all other the Holy Patriarchs, Prophets, Apoſtles, Martyrs, and all true Saints of God, who all, as the true Friends of God, were enemies and deſtroyers of Images and Idols, as the Enemies of God and his true Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion. Wherefore take heed and be wiſe, O ye beloved of the Lord, and that which others, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to Gods Word, beſtow wickedly, and to their damnation, upon dead ſtocks and ſtones (no Images, but Enemies of God and his Saints) that beſtow ye, as the faithful Servants of God, according to Gods Word, mercifully upon poor Men and Women, Fatherleſs Children, Widows, ſick Perſons, Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, Priſoners, and ſuch others that be in any
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:54673:147"/> neceſſity, that ye may at that great day of the Lord, hear that moſt bleſſed and comfortable ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of our Saviour Chriſt: <hi>Come ye bleſſed into the Kingdom of my Father, prepared for you before the beginning of the World. For I was hungry, and ye gave me meat, thirſty, and ye gave me drink, naked, and ye clothed me, harbourleſs, and ye lodged me, in Priſon, and ye viſited me, ſick, and ye comforted me. For whatſoever ye have done for the poor and needy in my name, and for my ſake, that have ye done for me.</hi> To the which his Heavenly Kingdom, God the Father of Mercies bring us, for Jeſus Chriſts ſake our only Saviour, Mediator, and Advocate, to whom with the Holy Ghoſt, one immortal, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſible, and moſt glorious God, be all Honour and Thankſgiving, and Glory, World without end. <hi>Amen.</hi>

                     <hi>AN HOMILY FOR</hi> Repairing and keeping clean, and comely adorning of Churches.</head>
                  <p>IT is a common cuſtom uſed of all men, when they intend to have their Friends or Neighbours to come to their Houſes to eat or drink with them, or to have any Solemn Aſſembly to treat and talk of any matter, they will have their Houſes, which they keep in continual reparations, to be clean and fine, leſt they ſhould be counted ſluttiſh, or little to regard their Friends and Neighbours. How much more then ought the Houſe of God, which we commonly call the Church, to be ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently repaired in all places, and to be honourably adorned and garniſhed, and to be kept clean and ſweet, to the comfort of the People that ſhall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſort thereunto.</p>
                  <p>It appeareth in the Holy Scripture, how Gods Houſe, which was called his Holy Temple, and was the Mother Church of all <hi>Jewry,</hi> fell ſometimes in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to decay, and was oftentimes profaned and defiled, through the negligence and ungodlineſs of ſuch as had the charge thereof. But when godly Kings and Governors were in place, then Commandment was given forthwith, that the Church and Temple of God ſhould be repaired, and the Devotion of the
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:54673:148"/> People to be gathered for the reparation of the ſame. We read in the fourth Book of the <hi>Kings,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">4 Kings 12.</note> how that King <hi>Joas,</hi> being a godly Prince, gave command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to the Prieſts, to convert certain Offerings of the People towards the reparation and amendment of Gods Temple.</p>
                  <p>Like commandment gave that moſt godly King <hi>Joſias,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">4 Kings 22.</note> concerning the reparation and re-edification of Gods Temple, which in his time he found in ſore decay. It hath pleaſed Almighty God, that theſe Hiſtories touching the re-edifying and repair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of his Holy Temple, ſhould be written at large, to the end we ſhould be taught thereby: Firſt, that God is well pleaſed that his People ſhould have a convenient place to reſort unto, and to come to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, to praiſe and magnifie Gods Holy Name.

Thirdly, God was ſore diſpleaſed with his People, becauſe they builded, decked, and trimmed up their own Houſes, and ſuffered Gods Houſe to be in ruine and decay, to lye uncomely and fulſomly. Wherefore God was ſore grieved with them, and plagued them, as appeareth in the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet <hi>Aggeus. Thus ſaith the Lord:</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Agge 1.</note> 
                     <hi>Is it time for you to dwell in your cieled Houſes, and the Lords Houſe not regarded? Ye have ſowed much, and ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered in but little; your meat and your clothes have neither filled you, nor made you warm, and he that had his wages, put it in a bottomleſs purſe.</hi> By theſe Plagues which God laid upon his People for neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lecting of his Temple, it may evidently appear that God will have his Temple, his Church, the place where his Congregation ſhall reſort to magnifie him, well edified, well repaired, and well maintained. Some neither regarding godlineſs, nor the place of
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:54673:149"/> godly exerciſe, will ſay, The Temple in the Old Law was commanded to be built and repaired by God himſelf, becauſe it had great Promiſes annexed unto it, and becauſe it was a figure, a Sacrament, or a ſignification of Chriſt, and alſo of his Church. To this may be eaſily anſwered: Firſt, that our Churches are not deſtitute of Promiſes, foraſmuch as our Saviour Chriſt ſaith, <hi>Where two or three are gathered together in my Name, there am I in the midſt among them.</hi> A great number therefore coming to Church together in the name of Chriſt, have there, that is to ſay in the Church, their God and Saviour Jeſus Chriſt preſent among the Congregation of his faithful People, by his grace, by his favour and godly aſſiſtance, according to his moſt aſſured and comfortable promiſes. Why then ought not Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian People to build them Temples and Churches, having as great promiſes of the preſence of God, as ever had <hi>Solomon</hi> for the material Temple which he did build? As touching the other point, that <hi>Solomon</hi>'s Temple was a figure of Chriſt: we know that now in the time of the clear light Chriſt Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus the Son of God, all ſhadows, figures, and ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifications are utterly gone, all vain and unprofi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table Ceremonies, both Jewiſh and Heatheniſh, fully aboliſhed. And therefore our Churches are not ſet up for figures and ſignifications of Meſſias and Chriſt to come, but for other godly and neceſſary purpoſes; that is to ſay, That like as every man hath his own Houſe to abide in, to refreſh himſelf in, to reſt in, with ſuch like commodities: So Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty God will have his Houſe and Place whither the whole Pariſh and Congregation ſhall reſort, which is called the Church and Temple of God, for that the Church, which is the company of Gods People, doth there aſſemble and come together to ſerve him. Not meaning hereby, that the Lord, whom the Heaven of heavens is not able to hold or compriſe, doth dwell in the Church of Lime and Stone, made with mans hands, as wholly and only
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:54673:149"/> contained there within, and no where elſe, for ſo he never dwelt in <hi>Solomon</hi>'s Temple. Moreover, the Church or Temple is counted and called Holy, yet not of it ſelf, but becauſe Gods People reſorting thereunto are Holy, and exerciſe themſelves in Holy and Heavenly things. And to the intent ye may underſtand further, why Churches were built among Chriſtian People, this was the greateſt conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; that God might have his place, and that God might have his time, duly to be honoured and ſerved of the whole multitude in the Pariſh. Firſt, there to hear and learn the bleſſed Word and Will of the everlaſting God. Secondly, that there the bleſſed Sacraments, which our Lord and Saviour Chriſt Jeſus hath ordained and appointed, ſhould be duly, reverently, and decently miniſtred. Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that there the whole multitude of Gods People in the Pariſh, ſhould with one voice and heart call upon the Name of God, magnifie and praiſe the Name of God, render earneſt and hearty thanks to our Heavenly Father for his heap of benefits daily and plentifully poured upon us, not forgetting to beſtow our Alms upon Gods Poor, to the intent God may bleſs us the more richly. Thus ye may well perceive and underſtand wherefore Churches were built and ſet up amongſt Chriſtian People, and dedicated and appointed to theſe godly uſes, and wholly exempted from all filthy, profane, and worldly uſes. Wherefore all they that have little mind or devotion to repair and build Gods Temple, are to be counted People of much ungodlineſs, ſpurning againſt good Order in Chriſts Church, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſing the true honour of God, with evil examples, offending and hindring their Neighbours otherwiſe well and godlily diſpoſed. The World thinketh it but a trifle to ſee their Church in ruine and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cay. But whoſo doth not lay to their helping hands, they ſin againſt God and his Holy Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation. For if it had not been ſin to neglect and ſlightly regard the re-edifying and building up again
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:54673:150"/> of his Temple, God would not have been ſo much grieved, and ſo ſoon have plagued his People, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they builded and decked their own Houſes ſo gorgeouſly, and deſpiſed the Houſe of God their Lord. It is ſin and ſhame to ſee ſo many Churches, ſo ruinous, and ſo foully decayed, almoſt in every corner. If a mans private Houſe wherein he dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth, be decayed, he will never ceaſe till it be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtored up again. Yea, if his Barn where he keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth his Corn be out of reparations, what diligence uſeth he to make it in perfect ſtate again? If his Stable for his Horſe, yea, the Stie for his Swine, be not able to hold out Water and Wind, how careful is he to do coſt thereon? And ſhall we be ſo mindful of our common baſe Houſes, deputed to ſo vile employment, and be forgetful towards the Houſe of God, wherein be treated the words of our eternal Salvation, wherein be miniſtred the Sacraments and Myſteries of our Redemption? The Fountain of our Regeneration is there pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented unto us, the partaking of the Body and Blood of our Saviour Chriſt, is there offered unto us: And ſhall we not eſteem the place where ſo Heavenly things are handled? Wherefore, if ye have any reverence to the ſervice of God, if ye have any common honeſty, if ye have any con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience in keeping of neceſſary and godly ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances, keep your Churches in good repair, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by ye ſhall not only pleaſe God, and deſerve his manifold Bleſſings, but alſo deſerve the good re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port of all godly People.</p>
                  <p>The ſecond point which appertaineth to the maintenance of Gods Houſe, is to have it well adorned, and comely and clean kept. Which things may be the more eaſily reformed, when the Church is well repaired. For like as men are well refreſhed and comforted, when they find their Houſes having all things in good Order, and all corners clean and ſweet: ſo when Gods Houſe, the Church, is well adorned, with places convenient to
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:54673:150"/> ſit in, with the Pulpit for the Preacher, with the Lords Table for the Miniſtration of his Holy Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, with the Font to Chriſten in, and alſo is kept clean, comely, and ſweetly, the People are more deſirous, and the more comforted to reſort thither, and to tarry there the whole time appointed them. With what earneſtneſs, with what vehement zeal did our Saviour Chriſt drive the buyers and ſellers out of the Temple of God,<note place="margin">Mat. 21.</note> and hurled down the Tables of the changers of Mony, and the Seats of the Dove-ſellers, and could not abide any man to carry a Veſſel through the Temple? He told them that they had made his Fathers Houſe a Den of Thieves, partly through their Superſtition, Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>criſie, falſe Worſhip, falſe Doctrine, and inſatiable Covetouſneſs, and partly through Contempt, abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing that place with walking and talking, with worldly matters without all fear of God, and due reverence to that place. What dens of Thieves the Churches of <hi>England</hi> have been made by the blaſphemous buying and ſelling the moſt precious Body and Blood of Chriſt in the Maſs, as the World was made to believe, as Diriges, at Months minds, at Trentals, in Abbeys and Chantries, beſides other horrible abuſes (Gods Holy Name be bleſſed for ever) which we now ſee and underſtand. All theſe abominations, they that ſupply the room of Chriſt, have cleanſed and purged the Churches of <hi>England</hi> of, taking away all ſuch fulſomneſs and filthineſs, as through blind Devotion and Ignorance hath crept into the Church theſe many hundred years. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, O ye good Chriſtian People, ye dearly belo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved in Chriſt Jeſus, ye that glory not in worldly and vain Religion, in phantaſtical adorning and decking, but rejoyce in heart to ſee the glory of God truly ſet forth, and the Churches reſtored to their ancient and godly uſe, render your hearty thanks to the goodneſs of Almighty God, who hath in our days ſtirred up the hearts not only of his godly Preachers and Miniſters, but alſo of his faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:54673:151"/> and moſt Chriſtian Magiſtrates and Governors, to bring ſuch godly things to paſs.</p>
                  <p>And foraſmuch as your Churches are ſcoured and ſwept from the ſinful and ſuperſtitious filthineſs wherewith they were defiled and disfigured: Do ye your parts, good People, to keep your Churches comely and clean, ſuffer them not to be defiled with Rain and Weather, with dung of Doves, and Owls, Stares, and Choughs, and other filthineſs, as it is foul and lamentable to behold in many places of this Country. It is the Houſe of Prayer, not the Houſe of talking, of walking, of brawling, of minſtrelſie, of Hawks, and Dogs. Provoke not the diſpleaſure and plagues of God, for deſpiſing and abuſing his Holy Houſe, as the wicked Jews did. But have God in your heart, be obedient to his bleſſed Will, bind your ſelves every Man and Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, to your power, toward the reparations and clean keeping of the Church, to the intent that ye may be partakers of Gods manifold Bleſſings, and that ye may be the better encouraged to reſort to your Pariſh Church, there to learn your Duty to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards God and your Neighbour, there to be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent and partakers of Chriſts Holy Sacraments, there to render thanks to your Heavenly Father for the manifold benefits which he daily poureth upon you, there to pray together, and to call upon Gods Holy Name, which be bleſſed World without end. <hi>Amen.</hi>

                        </note> And in another place he ſaith, Good works go not before in him which ſhall afterward be juſtified, but good works do follow after when a man is firſt juſtified. St. <hi>Paul</hi> therefore teacheth, that we muſt do good works for divers reſpects: Firſt, to ſhew our ſelves obedient Children unto our Heavenly Father, who hath ordained them, that we ſhould walk in them. Secondly, for that they are good declarations and teſtimonies of our juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Thirdly, that others ſeeing our good works, may the rather by them be ſtirred up and excited to glorifie our Father which is in Heaven. Let us not therefore be ſlack to do good works, ſeeing it is the will of God that we ſhould walk in them, aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring our ſelves that at the laſt day, every man ſhall receive of God for his labour done in true Faith, a greater reward than his works have deſerved. And becauſe ſomewhat ſhall now be ſpoken of one par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular good work, whoſe commendation is both in the Law and in the Goſpel: Thus much is ſaid in the beginning generally of all good works. Firſt, to remove out of the way of the ſimple and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>learned, this dangerous ſtumbling-block, that any man ſhould go about to purchaſe or buy Heaven with his works. Secondly, to take away (ſo much as may be) from envious minds, and ſlanderous tongues, all juſt occaſion of ſlanderous ſpeaking, as though good works were rejected. This good work which now ſhall be treated of, is Faſting, which is found in the Scriptures to be of two ſorts. The one outward, pertaining to the Body; the other inward, in the Heart and Mind. This outward Faſt,
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:54673:152"/> is an abſtinence from meat, drink, and all natural food, yea, from all delicious pleaſures and delecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions worldly. When this outward Faſt pertaineth to one particular man, or to a few, and not the whole number of the People, for cauſes which here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after ſhall be declared, then it is called a private Faſt: But when the whole multitude of Men, Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, and Children, in a Townſhip or City, yea, through a whole Country, do faſt, it is called a publick Faſt. Such was that Faſt which the whole multitude of the Children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> were com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded to keep the tenth day of the ſeventh month, becauſe Almighty God appointed that day to be a cleanſing day, a day of atonement, a time of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciliation, a day wherein the People were clean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed from their ſins. The order and manner how it was done, is written in the xvi. and xxiii.<note place="margin">Lev. 16. and 23.</note> Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of <hi>Leviticus.</hi> That day the People did lament, mourn, weep, and bewail their former ſins. And whoſoever upon that day did not humble his Soul, bewailing his ſins, as is ſaid, abſtaining from all bodily food, until the Evening, <hi>that ſoul</hi> (ſaith Almighty God) <hi>ſhould be deſtroyed from among his people.</hi> We do not read that <hi>Moſes</hi> ordained, by order of Law, any days of publick Faſt throughout the whole year, more than that one day. The Jews notwithſtanding had more times of common Faſting, which the Prophet <hi>Zachary</hi> reciteth to be the faſt of the fourth, the faſt of the fifth,<note place="margin">Zach. 8.</note> the faſt of the ſeventh, and the faſt of the tenth Month. But for that it appeareth not in the Law when they were inſtituted, it is to be judged, that thoſe other times of Faſting, more than the Faſt of the ſeventh month, were ordained among the Jews by the appointment of their Governors, rather of Devotion, than by an expreſs Commandment given from God. Upon the Ordinance of this general Faſt, good men took oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion to appoint to themſelves private Faſts, at ſuch times as they did either earneſtly lament and bewail their ſinful lives, or did addict themſelves to more
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:54673:153"/> fervent Prayer, that it might pleaſe God to turn his wrath from them, when either they were admoniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and brought to the conſideration thereof by the preaching of the Prophets, or otherwiſe when they ſaw preſent danger to hang over their heads. This ſorrowfulneſs of Heart, joyned with Faſting, they uttered ſometimes by their outward behaviour and geſture of Body, putting on Sackcloth, ſprinkling themſelves with aſhes and duſt, and ſitting or lying upon the Earth. For when good men feel in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves the heavy burden of ſin, ſee damnation to be the reward of it, and behold with the eye of their mind the horror of Hell, they tremble, they quake, and are inwardly touched with ſorrowfulneſs of heart for their offences, and cannot but accuſe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and open this their grief unto Almighty God, and call unto him for mercy. This being done ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly, their mind is ſo occupied, partly with ſorrow and heavineſs, partly with an earneſt deſire to be delivered from this danger of Hell and Damnation, that all deſire of meat and drink is laid apart, and loathſomneſs of all worldly things and pleaſure com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth in place, ſo that nothing then liketh them more, than to weep, to lament, to mourn, and both with words and behaviour of body, to ſhew themſelves weary of this life. Thus did <hi>David</hi> faſt, when he made interceſſion to Almighty God for the Childs life, begotten in Adultery of <hi>Bathſhtba, <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>riah</hi>'s Wife. King <hi>Ahab</hi> faſted after this ſort, when it repented him of murdering of <hi>Naboth,</hi> bewailing his own ſinful doings. Such was the <hi>Ninevites</hi> Faſt, brought to repentance by <hi>Jonas</hi> preaching. When forty thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand of the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> were ſlain in Battel againſt the <hi>Benjamites,</hi> the Scripture ſaith, <hi>All the Children of</hi> Iſrael, <hi>and the whole multitude of the People went to</hi> Bethel, <hi>and ſate there weeping before the Lord, and faſted all that day till night.</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Judges 20.</note> So did <hi>Daniel, Heſter, Nehemias,</hi> and many others in the Old Teſtament faſt. But if any man will ſay, it is true, ſo they faſted indeed, but we are not now under the yoke of the
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:54673:153"/> Law, we are ſet at liberty by the freedom of the Goſpel: therefore thoſe Rites and Cuſtoms of the old Law bind not us, except it can be ſhewed by the Scriptures of the New Teſtament, or by examples out of the ſame, that faſting now under the Goſpel, is a reſtraint of meat, drink, and all bodily food and pleaſures fro<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

The doubt there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore is, whether when we Faſt, we ought to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold from our bodies all meat and drink during the time of our Faſt, or no? That we ought ſo to do, may be well gathered upon a Queſtion moved by the <hi>Phariſees</hi> to Chriſt, and by his anſwer again to the ſame. <hi>Why</hi> (ſay they) <hi>do</hi> John's <hi>Diſciples faſt often,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Luke <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                        <hi>and pray, and we likewiſe? but thy Diſciples eat and drink, and faſt not at all.</hi> In this ſmooth Queſtion, they couch up ſubtilly this Argument or Reaſon: Whoſo faſteth not, that man is not of God. For Faſting and Prayer are works both commended and commanded of God in the Scriptures; and all good men, from <hi>Moſes</hi> till this time, as well the Prophets as others, have exerciſed themſelves in theſe works. <hi>John</hi> alſo and his Diſciples at this day do faſt oft, and pray much and ſo do we the <hi>Phariſees</hi> in like manner: But thy Diſciples faſt not at all, which if thou wilt deny, we can eaſily prove it. For whoſoever eateth and drinketh, faſteth not. Thy Diſciples eat and drink, therefore they faſt not. Of this we conclude (ſay they) neceſſarily, that neither art thou, nor yet thy Diſciples, of God. Chriſt maketh anſwer, ſaying, <hi>Can ye make that the children of the wedding ſhalt faſt, while the Bridegroom is with them?

                     <p>But here, beloved, let us note, that our Saviour Chriſt, in making his anſwer to their queſtion, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied not, but confeſſed that his Diſciples faſted not, and therefore agreeth to the <hi>Phariſees</hi> in this, as unto a manifeſt truth; that whoſo eateth and drinketh, faſteth not. Faſting then even by Chriſts aſſent, is a withholding of meat, drink, and all natural food from the Body, for the determined time of Faſting. And that it was uſed in the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive Church, appeareth moſt evidently by the <hi>Chalcedon</hi> Council, one of the four firſt General Councils. The Fathers aſſembled there, to the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of 630. conſidering with themſelves how ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable a thing Faſting is to God, when it is uſed according to his word: Again, having before their eyes alſo the great abuſes of the ſame crept into the Church at thoſe days, through the negligence of them which ſhould have taught the People the right uſe thereof, and by vain gloſſes, deviſed of men: to reform the ſaid abuſes, and to reſtore this ſo good and godly a work, to the true uſe thereof, decreed in that Council, that every Perſon as well in his private as publick Faſt, ſhould continue all the day without meat and drink, till after the Eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning Prayer. And whoſoever did eat or drink be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Evening Prayer was ended, ſhould be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted and reputed not to conſider the purity of his Faſt. This Canon teacheth ſo evidently how Faſting was uſed in the Primitive Church, as by
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:54673:154"/> words it cannot be more plainly expreſſed.</p>
                     <p>Faſting then, by the Decree of thoſe ſix hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred and thirty Fathers, grounding their determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation in this matter upon the Sacred Scriptures, and long continued uſage or practice, both of the Prophets and other godly Perſons, before the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Chriſt, and alſo of the Apoſtles and other devout men in the New Teſtament, is a withhold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of meat, drink, and all natural Food from the Body, for the determined time of Faſting. Thus much is ſpoken hitherto, to make plain unto you what Faſting is. Now hereafter ſhall be ſhewed the true and right uſe of Faſting.</p>
                     <p>Good works are not all of one ſort. For ſome are of themſelves, and of their own proper nature always good: as to love God above all things, to love thy Neighbour as thy ſelf, to honour thy Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and Mother, to honour the higher Powers, to give to every man that which is his due, and ſuch like. Other works there be, which conſidered in themſelves, without further reſpect, are of their own nature meerly indifferent, that is, neither good nor evil, but take their denomination of the uſe or end whereunto they ſerve. Which works having a good end, are called good works, and are ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed: but yet that cometh not of themſelves, but of the good end whereunto they are referred. On the other ſide, if the end that they ſerve unto, be evil, it cannot then otherwiſe be, but that they muſt needs be evil alſo. Of this ſort of works, is Faſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, which of it ſelf is a thing meerly indifferent: but it is made better or worſe by the end that it ſerveth unto. For when it repecteth a good end, it is a good work; but the end being evil, the work it ſelf is alſo evil. To Faſt then with this per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſion of mind, that our Faſting, and our Good Works, can make us perfect and juſt men, and finally, bring us to Heaven, is a deviliſh perſwaſion, and that Faſt is ſo far off from pleaſing of God, that it refuſeth his mercy, and is altogether derogatory to
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:54673:155"/> the merits of Chriſts death, and his precious blood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhedding. This doth the Parable of the <hi>Phariſee</hi> and the <hi>Publican</hi> teach.<note place="margin">Luke 18.</note> 
                        <hi>Two men</hi> (ſaith Chriſt) <hi>went up together into the Temple to pray, the one a</hi> Phariſee, <hi>the other a</hi> Publican: <hi>the</hi> Phariſee <hi>ſtood and prayed thus with himſelf, I thank thee, O God, that I am not as other men are, extortioners, unjuſt, adulterers, and as this</hi> Publican <hi>is; I faſt twice in the week, I give tithes of all that I poſſeſs. The</hi> Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lican <hi>ſtood afar off, and would not lift up his eyes to Heaven, but ſmote his breaſt, and ſaid, God be mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciful to me a ſinner.</hi> In the Perſon of this <hi>Phariſee,</hi> our Saviour Chriſt ſetteth out to the eye, and to the judgment of the World, a perfect, juſt, and righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous man, ſuch a one as i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> not ſpotted with thoſe vices that men commonly are infected with, Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tortion, Bribery, polling and pilling their Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, robbers and ſpoilers of Common-weals, crafty, and ſubtil in chopping and changing, uſing falſe Weights, and deteſtable Perjury in their buying and ſelling, Fornicators, Adulterers, and vicious Livers. The <hi>Phariſee</hi> was no ſuch man, neither faulty in any ſuch like notorious Crime. But where other tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſed by leaving things undone, which yet the Law required: this man did more than was requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite by the Law. For he faſted twice in the week, and gave Tithes of all that he had. What could the World then juſtly blame in this man? yea, what outward thing more could be deſired to be in him, to make him a more perfect, and a more juſt man? Truly, nothing by mans judgment: And yet our Saviour Chriſt preferreth the poor <hi>Publican</hi> without Faſting, before him with his Faſt. The cauſe why he doth ſo, is manifeſt. For the <hi>Publican</hi> having no good works at all to truſt unto, yielded up him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf unto God, confeſſing his ſins, and hoped cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly to be ſaved by Gods free mercy only. The <hi>Phariſee</hi> gloried, and truſted ſo much to his works, that he thought himſelf ſure enough without mercy, and that he ſhould come to Heaven by his Faſting,
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:54673:155"/> and other deeds. To this end ſerveth that Parable. For it is ſpoken to them that truſted in themſelves, that they were righteous, and deſpiſed others. Now, becauſe the <hi>Phariſee</hi> directeth his works to an evil end, ſeeking by them juſtification, which indeed is the proper work of God without our merits, his Faſting twice in the week, and all his other works, though they were never ſo many, and ſeemed to the World never ſo good and Holy, yet in very deed before God they are altogether evil and abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minable. The mark alſo that the Hypocrites ſhoot at with their Faſt, is, to appear Holy in the eye of the World, and ſo to win commendation and praiſe of men. But our Saviour Chriſt ſaith of them,<note place="margin">Mat. 6.</note> 
                        <hi>they have their reward;</hi> that is, they have praiſe and commendation of Men, but of God they have none at all. For whatſoever tendeth to an evil end, is it ſelf, by that evil end, made evil alſo. Again, ſo long as we keep ungodlineſs in our hearts, and ſuffer wicked thoughts to tarry there, though we Faſt as oft as did either St. <hi>Paul</hi> or <hi>John Baptiſt,</hi> and keep it as ſtrictly as did the <hi>Ninevites:</hi> yet ſhall it be not only unprofitable to us, but alſo a thing that greatly diſpleaſeth Almighty God. For he ſaith, <hi>that his ſoul abhorreth and hateth ſuch Faſtings,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Iſai 1.</note> 
                        <hi>yea, they are a burthen unto him, and he is weary of bearing them.</hi> And therefore he inveigheth moſt ſharply againſt them, ſaying by the mouth of the Prophet <hi>Iſaiah, Behold, when you faſt,</hi>

Now ye ſhall not faſt thus, that you may make your voice to be heard above. Think ye this faſt pleaſeth me, that a man ſhould chaſten him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf for a day? Should that be called a faſting, or a day that pleaſeth the Lord?</hi> Now dearly beloved, ſeeing that Almighty God alloweth not our Faſt for the works ſake, but chiefly reſpecteth our heart, how it is affected, and then eſteemeth our Faſt either good or evil, by the end that it ſerveth for:
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:54673:156"/> it is our part to rent our Hearts, and not our Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,<note place="margin">Joel 2.</note> as we are advertiſed by the Prophet <hi>Joel;</hi> that is, our ſorrow and mourning muſt be inward in heart, and not in outward ſhew only; yea, it is requiſite that firſt before all things, we cleanſe our hearts from ſin, and then direct our Faſt to ſuch an end as God will allow to be good.</p>
                     <p>There be three ends whereunto if our Faſt be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected, it is then a work profitable to us, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted of God.</p>
                     <p>The firſt is, to chaſtiſe the Fleſh, that it be not too wanton,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 9.</note> but tamed and brought in ſubjection to the Spirit. This reſpect had St. <hi>Paul</hi> in his Faſt, when he ſaid, <hi>I chaſtiſe my body, and bring it into ſubjection, leſt by any means it cometh to paſs, that when I have preached to others, I my ſelf be found a caſtaway.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <note place="margin">Acts 13.</note>The ſecond, that the Spirit may be more earneſt and fervent to Prayer. To this end faſted the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets and Teachers that were at <hi>Antioch,</hi> before they ſent forth <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas</hi> to preach the Goſpel. The ſame two Apoſtles faſted for the like purpoſe, when they commended to God, by their earneſt Prayers, the Congregations that were at <hi>Antioch,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Acts 14.</note> 
                        <hi>Piſidia, Iconium,</hi> and <hi>Lyſtra,</hi> as we read in the <hi>Acts</hi> of the Apoſtles.</p>
                     <p>The third, that our Faſt be a Teſtimony and Witneſs with us before God, of our humble ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion to his high Majeſty, when we confeſs and acknowledge our ſins unto him, and are inwardly touched with ſorrowfulneſs of heart, bewailing the ſame in the affliction of our Bodies. Theſe are the three ends, or right uſes of Faſting. The firſt belongeth moſt properly to private Faſts: the other two are common, as well to publick Faſts, as to private: and thus much for the uſe of Faſting. Lord have mercy upon us, and give us grace, that while we live in this miſerable World, we may through thy help bring forth this, and ſuch other fruits of the Spirit, commended and commanded
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:54673:156"/> in thy Holy Word, to the glory of thy Name, and to our comforts, that after the race of this wretched life, we may live everlaſtingly with thee in thy Heavenly Kingdom, not for the merits and worthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of our works, but for thy mercies ſake, and the merits of thy dear Son, Jeſus Chriſt, to whom with thee and the Holy Ghoſt, be all Laud, Honour, and Glory, for ever and ever. <hi>Amen.</hi>

                     <p>IN the former Homily (beloved) was ſhewed, that among the People of the Jews, Faſting as it was commanded them from God by <hi>Moſes,</hi> was to ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtain the whole day, from Morning till Night, from Meat, Drink, and all manner of Food, that nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſheth the Body, and that whoſo taſted ought be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Evening, on the day appointed to Faſting, was accounted among them a breaker of his Faſt.

<pb n="300" facs="tcp:54673:157"/> and keeping thereof, but that the Higher Powers have full liberty to alter and change every ſuch Law and Ordinance, either Eccleſiaſtical or Political, when time and place ſhall require. But firſt an Anſwer ſhall be made to a Queſtion that ſome may make, demanding what judgment we ought to have of ſuch abſtinences as are appointed by publick Order and Laws made by Princes, and by the Authority of the Magiſtrates, upon Policy, not reſpecting any Religion at all in the ſame. As when any Realm in conſideration of the maintain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Fiſher-Towns bordering upon the Seas, and for the increaſe of Fiſher-men, of whom do ſpring Mariners to go upon the Sea, to the furniſhing of the Navy of the Realm, whereby not only Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities of other Countries may be tranſported, but alſo may be a neceſſary defence to reſiſt the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaſion of the Adverſary.</p>
                     <p>For the better underſtanding of this Queſtion, it is neceſſary that we make a difference between the Policies of Princes, made for the ordering of their Commonweals, in proviſion of things ſerving to the moſt ſure defence of their Subjects and Countries, and between Eccleſiaſtical Policies, in preſcribing ſuch works, by which, as by ſecondary means, Gods wrath may be pacified, and his mercy purchaſed. Poſitive Laws made by Princes, for conſervation of their Policy, not repugnant unto Gods Law, ought of all Chriſtian Subjects with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence of the Magiſtrate to be obeyed, not only for fear of Puniſhment, <hi>but alſo</hi> (as the Apoſtle ſaith) <hi>for conſcience ſake.</hi> Conſcience, I ſay, not of the thing which of its own nature is indifferent, but of our Obedience, which by the Law of God we owe unto the Magiſtrate, as unto Gods Miniſter. By which poſitive Laws, though we Subjects for certain times and days appointed, be reſtrained from ſome kinds of Meats and Drink, which God by his Holy Word hath left free to be taken and uſed of all men with thankſgiving in all places,
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:54673:157"/> and at all times: yet for that ſuch Laws of Princes and other Magiſtrates are not made to put Holineſs in one kind of Meat and Drink more than another, to make one day more holy than another, but are grounded meerly upon Policy, all Subjects are bound in Conſcience to keep them by Gods Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, who by the Apoſtle willeth all without ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception, to ſubmit themſelves unto the Authority of the Higher Powers. And in this point con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning our Duties which be here dwelling in <hi>England,</hi> environed with the Sea, as we be, we have great occaſion in reaſon to take the Commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities of the Water, which Almighty God by his Divine Providence hath laid ſo nigh unto us, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by the increaſe of Victuals upon the Land may the better be ſpared and cheriſhed, to the ſooner re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing of Victuals to a more moderate price, to the better ſuſtenance of the Poor. And doubtleſs he ſeemeth to be too dainty an <hi>Engliſh-man,</hi> who conſidering the great Commodities which may en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſue, will not forbear ſome piece of his licentious Appetite upon the Ordinance of his Prince, with the conſent of the Wiſe of the Realm. What good <hi>Engliſh</hi> heart would not wiſh that the old ancient glory ſhould return to the Realm, wherein it hath with great commendations excelled before our days, in the furniture of the Navy of the ſame? What will more daunt the Hearts of the Adverſaries, than to ſee us well fenced and armed on the Sea, as we be reported to be on the Land? If the Prince re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſted our obedience to forbear one day from fleſh more than we do, and to be be contented with one meal in the ſame day, ſhould not our own Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modity thereby perſwade us to ſubjection? But now that two meals be permitted on that day to be uſed, which ſometime our Elders in very great numbers in the Realm did uſe with one only ſpare meal, and that in Fiſh only: ſhall we think it ſo great a bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then that is preſcribed?</p>
                     <pb n="302" facs="tcp:54673:158"/>
                     <p>Furthermore, conſider the decay of the Towns nigh the Seas, which ſhould be moſt ready by the number of the People there to repulſe the Enemy, and we which dwell further off upon the Land, having them as our Buckler to defend us, ſhould be the more in ſafety. If they be our Neighbours, why ſhould we not wiſh them to proſper? If they be our defence as nigheſt at hand to repel the Enemy, to keep out the rage of the Seas, which elſe would break in upon our fair Paſtures, why ſhould we not cheriſh them? Neither do we urge that in the Eccleſiaſtical Policy, preſcribing a form of Faſting, to humble our ſelves in the ſight of Almighty God, that that Order which was uſed among the Jews, and practiſed by Chriſts Apoſtles after his aſcenſion, is of ſuch force and neceſſity, that that only ought to be uſed among Chriſtians, and none other, for that were to bind Gods People unto the yoke and burthen of <hi>Moſes</hi> his Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licy; yea, it were the very way to bring us which are ſet at liberty by the freedom of Chriſts Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel, into the bondage of the Law again, which God forbid that any man ſhould attempt or purpoſe. But to this end it ſerveth, to ſhew how far the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of Faſting now uſed in the Church at this day, differeth from that which was then uſed. Gods Church ought not, neither may it be ſo tyed to that or any other Order now made, or hereafter to be made and deviſed by the Authority of Man, but that it may lawfully, for juſt cauſes, alter, change, or mitigate thoſe Eccleſiaſtical Decrees and Orders, yea, recede wholly from them; and break them, when they tend either to Superſtition, or to Impiety, when they draw the People from God, rather than work any edification in them. This Authority Chriſt himſelf uſed, and left it to his Church. He uſed it, I ſay, for the Order or De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree made by the Elders for waſhing oft times, which was diligently obſerved of the Jews; yet tending to Superſtition, our Saviour Chriſt altered
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:54673:158"/> and changed the ſame in his Church, into a profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table Sacrament, the Sacrament of our Regenera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or New Birth. This Authority to mitigate Laws and Decrees Eccleſiaſtical, the Apoſtles pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſed, when they, writing from <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> unto the Congregation that was at <hi>Antioch,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Acts 15.</note> ſignified un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them that they would not lay any further bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then upon them, but theſe neceſſaries: that is, <hi>that they ſhould abſtain from things offered unto Idols, from blood, from that which is ſtrangled, and from fornication,</hi> notwithſtanding that <hi>Moſes</hi> Law re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired many other obſervances. This Authority to change the Orders, Decrees, and Conſtitutions of the Church, was after the Apoſtles time uſed of the Fathers about the manner of Faſting, as it appeareth in the Tripartite Hiſtory,<note place="margin">Tripart. hiſt. l. <hi>9.</hi> c. <hi>38.</hi>
                        </note> where it is thus written, <hi>Touching Faſting, we find that it was diverſly uſed in divers places by divers men. For they at</hi> Rome <hi>faſt three weeks together before Eaſter, ſaving upon the Saturdays and Sundays, which Faſt they call Lent.</hi> And after a few lines in the ſame place, it followeth: <hi>They have not all one uniform Order in Faſting. For ſome do faſt and abſtain both from fiſh and fleſh. Some when they faſt, eat nothing but fiſh. Others there are, which when they Faſt, eat of all water-fowls, as well as of fiſh, grounding themſelves upon</hi> Moſes, <hi>that ſuch Fowls have their ſubſtance of the Water, as the Fiſhes have. Some others when they Faſt, will neither eat Herbs nor Eggs. Some faſters there are, that eat nothing but dry bread. Others when they Faſt, eat nothing at all; no, not ſo much as dry bread. Some faſt from all manner of food till Night, and then eat, without making any choice or difference of meats.</hi> And a thouſand ſuch like divers kinds of Faſting may be found in divers places of the World, of divers men diverſly uſed.<note place="margin">Euſeb. lib. <hi>5.</hi> cap. <hi>24.</hi>
                        </note> And for all this great diverſity in Faſting, yet Charity the very true bond of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Peace was not broken, neither did the diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity of Faſting break at any time their agreement
<pb n="304" facs="tcp:54673:159" rendition="simple:additions"/> and concord in Faith. To abſtain ſometimes from certain meats, not becauſe the meats are evil, but becauſe they are not neceſſary; this abſtinence (ſaith St. <hi>Auguſtine</hi>) is not evil.<note place="margin">Dogma Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſt. c. <hi>66.</hi>
                        </note> And to reſtrain the uſe of meats when neceſſity and time ſhall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire, this (ſaith he) doth properly pertain to Chriſtian men.</p>
                     <p>Thus ye have heard, good People, firſt, that Chriſtian Subjects are bound even in Conſcience to obey Princes Laws, which are not repugnant to the Laws of God. Ye have alſo heard that Chriſts Church is not ſo bound to obſerve any Order, Law, or Decree made by Man, to preſcribe a form in Religion: but that the Church hath full Power and Authority from God, to change and alter the ſame, when need ſhall require, which hath been ſhewed you by the example of our Saviour Chriſt, by the practice of the Apoſtles, and of the Fathers ſince that time.</p>
                     <p>Now ſhall be ſhewed briefly what time is meet for Faſting, for all times ſerve not for all things: but as the Wiſe man ſaith,<note place="margin">Eccleſ. 3.</note> 
                        <hi>All things have their times. There is a time to weep, and a time again to laugh, a time to mourn, and a time to rejoyce,</hi> &amp;c. Our Saviour Chriſt excuſed his Diſciples, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved the <hi>Phariſees,</hi> becauſe they neither regarded the uſe of Faſting, nor conſidered what time was meet for the ſame. Which both he teacheth in his anſwer,<note place="margin">Mat. 9.</note> ſaying, <hi>The children of the marriage can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not mourn, while the bridegroom is with them.</hi> Their queſtion was of Faſting, his anſwer is of Mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, ſignifying unto them plainly, that the outward Faſt of the Body, is no Faſt before God, except it be accompanied with the inward Faſt, which is a mourning and a lamentation of the Heart, as is before declared. Concerning the time of Faſting, he ſaith, <hi>The days will come, when the bridegroom ſhall be taken from them, in thoſe days they ſhall faſt.</hi> By this it is manifeſt, that it is no time of Faſting while the Marriage laſteth, and the Bridegroom is
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:54673:159"/> there preſent. But when the Marriage is ended,<note place="margin">Luke 5. Mat. 6.</note> and the Bridegroom gone, then is it a meet time to Faſt. Now, to make plain unto you what is the ſenſe and meaning of theſe words, <hi>We are at the marriage;</hi> and again, <hi>The bridegroom is taken from us:</hi> Ye ſhall note, that ſo long as God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealeth his mercy unto us, and giveth us of his benefits, either Spiritual or Corporal, we are ſaid to be with the Bridegroom at the Marriage. So was that good Old Father <hi>Jacob</hi> at the Marriage, when he underſtood that his Son <hi>Joſeph</hi> was alive, and Ruled all <hi>Egypt</hi> under King <hi>Pharaoh.</hi> So was <hi>David</hi> in the Marriage with the Bridegroom when he had gotten the Victory of great <hi>Goliath,</hi> and had ſmitten off his Head. <hi>Judith,</hi> and all the People of <hi>Bethulia,</hi> were the Children of the Wed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, and had the Bridegroom with them, when God had by the Hand of a Woman ſlain <hi>Holofernes,</hi> the grand Captain of the <hi>Aſſyrians</hi> Hoſt, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comfited all their Enemies. Thus were the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles the Children of the Marriage, while Chriſt was corporally preſent with them, and defended them from all dangers, both ſpiritual and corporal. But the Marriage is ſaid then to be ended, and the Bridegroom to be gone, when Almighty God ſmiteth us with Affliction, and ſeemeth to leave us in the midſt of a number of Adverſities. So God ſometimes ſtriketh private men privately with ſundry adverſities, as trouble of Mind, loſs of Friends, loſs of Goods, long and dangerous Sickneſſes, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> then is it a fit time for that man to humble himſelf to Almighty God by Faſting, and to mourn and bewail his ſins with a ſorrowful heart, and to Pray unfeignedly, ſaying with the Prophet <hi>David, Turn away thy face,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Pſal. 51.</note> 
                        <hi>O Lord, from my ſins, and blot out of thy remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance all mine offences.</hi> Again, when God ſhall afflict a whole Region or Country with Wars, with Famine, with Peſtilence, with ſtrange Diſeaſes and unknown Sickneſſes, and other ſuch like Calami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties: then it is time for all ſtates and ſorts of Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
<pb n="306" facs="tcp:54673:160"/> high and low, Men, Women, and Children, to humble themſelves by Faſting, and bewail their ſinful living before God, and Pray with one com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon voice, ſaying thus, or ſome other ſuch like Prayer. <hi>Be favourable, O Lord, be favourable unto thy People, which turn unto thee, in weeping, faſting, and praying, ſpare thy people whom thou haſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemed with thy precious blood, and ſuffer not thine inheritance to be deſtroyed and brought to confuſion.</hi> Faſting thus uſed with Prayer, is of great efficacy, and weigheth much with God. So the Angel <hi>Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phael</hi> told <hi>Tobias.</hi> It alſo appeareth by that which our Saviour Chriſt anſwered to his Diſciples, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding of him why they could not caſt forth the evil Spirit out of him that was brought unto them. <hi>This kind</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>is not caſt out but by faſting and prayer.</hi> How available Faſting is, how much it weigheth with God, and what it is able to obtain at his hand, cannot better be ſet forth, than by opening unto you, and laying before you ſome of thoſe notable things that have been brought to paſs by it. Faſting was one of the means whereby Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty God was occaſioned to alter the thing which he had purpoſed concerning <hi>Ahab,</hi> for murdering the innocent man <hi>Naboth,</hi> to poſſeſs his Vineyard. <hi>God ſpake unto</hi> Elijah,<note place="margin">3 Kings 21.</note> 
                        <hi>ſaying, Go thy way and ſay unto</hi> Ahab, <hi>Haſt thou killed, and alſo gotten poſſeſſion? Thus ſaith the Lord, In the place where Dogs licked the blood of</hi> Naboth, <hi>ſhall Dogs even lick thy blood alſo. Behold, I will bring evil upon thee, and will take away thy Poſterity: Yea, the Dogs ſhall eat him of</hi> Ahab's <hi>ſtock that dieth in the City, and him that dieth in the Field ſhall the fowls of the air eat.</hi> This Puniſhment had Almighty God determined for <hi>Ahab</hi> in this World, and to deſtroy all the Male-kind that was begotten of <hi>Ahab</hi>'s Body, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides that puniſhment which ſhould have happened unto him in the World to come. <hi>When</hi> Ahab <hi>heard this, he rent his clothes, and put ſackcloth upon him, and faſted, and lay in ſackcloth, and went bare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>footed.
<pb n="307" facs="tcp:54673:160"/> Then the word of the Lord came to</hi> Elijah, <hi>ſaying, Seeſt thou how</hi> Ahab <hi>is humbled before me? Becauſe he ſubmitteth himſelf before me, I will not bring that evil in his days, but in his ſons days will I bring it upon his Houſe.</hi> Although <hi>Ahab,</hi> through the wicked counſel of <hi>Jezabel</hi> his Wife, had com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted ſhameful Murder, and againſt all right diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inherited and diſpoſſeſſed for ever <hi>Naboth</hi>'s ſtock <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 span">

Here we may ſee of what force our outward Faſt is, when it is accompanied with the inward Faſt of the Mind, which is (as is ſaid) a ſorrowfulneſs of Heart, deteſting and bewailing our ſinful do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings. The like is to be ſeen in the <hi>Ninevites:</hi> For when God had determined to deſtroy the whole City of <hi>Nineve,</hi> and the time which he had ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed, was even now at hand, he ſet the Prophet <hi>Jonas</hi> to ſay unto them, <hi>Yet forty days,</hi>

                        <hi>and</hi> Nineve <hi>ſhall be overthrown. The people by and by believed God, and gave themſelves to faſting, yea, the King, by the advice of his Counſel, cauſed to be proclaimed, ſaying, Let neither man nor beaſt, bullock nor ſheep taſte any thing, neither feed nor drink water: But let man and beaſt put on ſackcloth, and cry mightily unto God, yea, let every man turn from his evil way, and from the wickedneſs that is in their hands. Who can tell if God will turn and repent, and turn away from his fierce wrath, that we periſh not?</hi> And upon this their hearty Repentance, thus declared out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly with Faſting, renting of their clothes, putting on ſackcloth, and ſprinkling themſelves with duſt and aſhes, the Scripture ſaith, <hi>God ſaw their works that they turned from their evil ways, and God repented of the evil that he had ſaid he would do unto them, and he did it not.</hi> Now beloved, ye
<pb n="308" facs="tcp:54673:161"/> have heard firſt what Faſting is, as well that which is outward in the Body, as that which is inward in the Heart.

<pb n="311" facs="tcp:54673:162"/> his favourable countenance ſo far from us, that he ſhould clean bar us out of the doors, and diſinherit us of his Heavenly Kingdom. But he ſo much abhorreth all beaſtly Banqueting, that by his Son our Saviour Chriſt in the Goſpel, he declareth his terrible indignation againſt all belly-gods, in that he pronounceth them accurſed, ſaying,<note place="margin">Luke 6.</note> 
                     <hi>Wo be to you that are full, for ye ſhall hunger.</hi> And by the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet <hi>Iſaiah</hi> he cryeth out,<note place="margin">Eſai. 5.</note> 
                     <hi>Wo be to you that riſe up early to give your ſelves to drunkenneſs, and ſet all your mind ſo on drinking, that you ſit ſwilling thereat until it be night. The Harp, the Lute, the Shalm, and plenty of Wine are at your Feaſts, but the works of the Lord ye do not behold, neither con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider the works of his hands. Wo be unto you that are ſtrong to drink wine, and are mighty to advance drunkenneſs.</hi> Here the Prophet plainly teacheth, that Feaſting and Banqueting make men forgetful of their Duty towards God, when they give them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to all kinds of pleaſures, not conſidering nor regarding the works of the Lord, who hath created meats and drinks, as St. Paul ſaith,<note place="margin">1 Tim. 4.</note> to be received thankfully of them that believe and know the truth. So that the very beholding of theſe Creatures (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the handy work of Almighty God) might teach us to uſe them thankfully as God hath or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained. Therefore they are without excuſe before God, which either filthily feed themſelves, not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecting the ſanctification which is by the Word of God and Prayer, or elſe unthankfully abuſe the good Creatures of God by ſurfeiting and drunkenneſs, foraſmuch as Gods Ordinances in his Creatures plainly forbids it. They that give themſelves there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to bibbing and banqueting, being without all conſideration of Gods Judgments, are ſuddenly oppreſſed in the day of vengeance. Therefore Chriſt ſaith to his Diſciples,<note place="margin">Luke 21.</note> 
                     <hi>Take heed to your ſelves, leſt at any time your hearts be overcome with ſurfeiting and drunkenneſs, and cares of his world, and ſo that day come on you unawares.</hi> Whoſoever then
<pb n="312" facs="tcp:54673:163"/> will take warning at Chriſt, let him take heed to himſelf, leſt his heart being overwhelmed by ſurfeit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and drowned in drunkenneſs, he be taken un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>awares with that unthrifty Servant, <hi>which, think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing not on his Maſters coming, began to ſmite his fellow-ſervants, and to eat, and to drink, and to be drunken,</hi> and being ſuddenly taken, hath his juſt Reward with unbelieving Hypocrites, they that uſe to drink deeply, and to feed at full (wallowing themſelves in all kind of wickedneſs) are brought aſleep in that ſlumbring forgetfulneſs of Gods Holy Will and Commandments. Therefore Almighty God cryeth by the Prophet <hi>Joel:</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Joel 1.</note> 
                     <hi>Awake ye drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kards, weep and howl all ye drinkers of wine, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the new wine ſhall be pulled from your mouth.</hi> Here the Lord terribly threatneth to withdraw his benefits from ſuch as abuſe them, and to pull the Cup from the mouth of Drunkards. Here we may learn, not to ſleep in Drunkenneſs and Surfeiting, leſt God deprive us of the uſe of his Creatures, when we unkindly abuſe them. For certainly the Lord our God will not only take away his benefits when they are unthankfully abuſed: but alſo in his wrath and heavy diſpleaſure take vengeance on ſuch as immo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derately abuſe them.<note place="margin">Gen. 3.</note> If our firſt Parents <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve</hi> had not obeyed their greedy Appetite in eating the forbidden Fruit, neither had they loſt the fruition of Gods benefits which they then en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyed in Paradiſe, neither had they brought ſo many miſchiefs both to themſelves, and to all their Poſterity. But when they paſſed the bounds that God appointed them, as unworthy of Gods bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits, they are expelled and driven out of Paradiſe, they may no longer eat the Fruits of that Garden, which by exceſs they had ſo much abuſed. As tranſgreſſors of Gods Commandment, they and their Poſterity are brought to a perpetual ſhame and confuſion, and as accurſed of God, they muſt now ſweat for their living, which before had abundance at their pleaſure. Even ſo, if we in eating and
<pb n="313" facs="tcp:54673:163"/> drinking exceed, when God of his large liberality ſendeth plenty, he will ſoon change plenty into ſcarceneſs. And whereas we gloried in fulneſs, he will make us empty, and confound us with penury, yea, we ſhall be compelled to labour and travel with pains, in ſeeking for that which we ſometime enjoyed at eaſe. Thus the Lord will not leave them unpuniſhed, who not regarding his works, follow the luſts and appetites of their own hearts. The Patriarch <hi>Noah,</hi>

                     </note> whom the Apoſtle calleth the Preacher of Righteouſneſs, a man exceedingly in Gods favour, is in Holy Scripture made an Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, whereby we may learn to avoid Drunken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. For when he had poured in Wine more than was convenient, in filthy manner he lay naked in his Tent, his Privities diſcovered.

Yet notwithſtanding, after this he left not his banqueting, but in one Night ſwilled in ſo much Wine, that he fell into a Fever; and when as by no means he would abſtain from Wine, within few days after in miſerable ſort he ended his life. The Conqueror of the whole World is made a Slave by exceſs, and becometh ſo mad, that he murdereth his dear Friend, he is plagued with ſorrow, ſhame, and grief of heart for his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temperance, yet can he not leave it, he is kept in captivity, and he which ſometime had ſubdued many, is become a ſubject to the vile belly. So are Drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kards and Gluttons altogether without power of themſelves, and the more they drink, the dryer they wax, one Banquet provoketh another, they ſtudy to fill their greedy ſtomacks. Therefore it is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly ſaid, <hi>A drunken man is always dry,</hi> and <hi>A glutton's gut is never filled.</hi> Unſatiable truly are the affections and luſts of mans heart, and therefore we muſt learn to bridle them with the fear of God, ſo that we yield not to our own luſts, leſt we kindle Gods indignation againſt our ſelves, when we ſeek to ſatisfie our beaſtly Appetite.

Whoſoever he be then, that by eating and drinking maketh himſelf unfit to ſerve God, let him not think to eſcape unpuniſhed.</p>
                  <p>Ye have heard how much Almighty God deteſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the abuſe of his Creatures, as he himſelf decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth, as well by his Holy Word, as alſo by the fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful examples of his juſt judgment. Now, if neither the Word of God can reſtrain our raging luſts and greedy appetites, neither the manifeſt examples of Gods vengeance fear us from riotous and exceſſive eating and drinking, let us yet conſider the manifold miſchiefs that proceed thereof, ſo ſhall we know the Tree by the Fruits. It hurteth the Body, it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecteth the Mind, it waſteth the Subſtance, and is noyſom to the Neighbours. But who is able to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs the manifold dangers and inconveniencies that follow of intemperate Diet? Oft cometh ſudden Death by banqueting, ſometimes the Members are diſſolved, and ſo the whole Body is brought into a miſerable ſtate. He that eateth and drinketh im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meaſurably, kindleth oft times ſuch an unnatural heat in his body, that his appetite is provoked thereby to deſire more than it ſhould, or elſe it overcometh his ſtomach, and filleth all the Body full of ſluggiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, makes it unable and unfit to ſerve either God or Man, not nouriſhing the Body, but hurting it; and laſt of all, bringing many kinds of incurable Diſeaſes, whereof enſueth ſometimes deſperate Death. But what ſhould I need to ſay any more in this behalf? For except God bleſs our Meats, and give them ſtrength to feed us; again, except God give ſtrength to Nature to digeſt, ſo that we may take profit by them, either ſhall we filthily vomit them up again, or elſe ſhall they lie ſtinking in our bodies, as in a
<pb n="317" facs="tcp:54673:165"/> lothſom ſink and channel, and ſo diverſly infect the whole Body. And ſurely the bleſſing of God is ſo far from ſuch as uſe riotous banqueting, that in their faces be ſometimes ſeen the expreſs tokens of this intemperancy; as <hi>Solomon</hi> noteth in his <hi>Proverbs. To whom is wo</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>to whom is ſorrow?</hi>

It were expedient that ſuch delicate Perſons ſhould be ruled by <hi>Solomon,</hi> who in conſideration of the aforeſaid inconvenien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, forbiddeth the very ſight of Wine. <hi>Look not upon the wine</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>when it is red, and when it ſheweth his colour in the cup, or goeth down plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſantly: for in the end thereof it will bite like a Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent, and hurt like a Cockatrice.

But ſome will ſay, what need any to find fault with this? He hurteth no man but himſelf, he is no mans foe but his own. Indeed I know this is commonly ſpoken in defence of theſe beaſtly belly-gods, but it is eaſie to ſee how hurtful they are, not only to themſelves, but alſo to the Common-wealth by their example.

They are unprofitable to the Common-wealth. For a drunkard is neither fit to Rule, nor to be ruled.

<pb n="323" facs="tcp:54673:168"/> abuſes thereof, which he forbiddeth and diſalloweth, as it may appear by the inconveniencies which daily increaſe, by the juſt judgment of God, where that meaſure is not kept, which he himſelf hath appointed.

Even as in Herbs, Trees, and ſundry Fruits, we have not only divers neceſſary uſes, but alſo the pleaſant ſight and ſweet ſmell, to delight us withal, wherein we may behold the ſingular love of God towards mankind, in that he hath provided both to relieve our neceſſities, and alſo to refreſh our ſenſes with an honeſt and moderate recreation.

The ſecond is written by St. <hi>Paul,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">1 Cor. 7.</note> in the ſeventh Chapter of his firſt Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle to the <hi>Corinths,</hi> where he teacheth us to uſe this World, as though we uſed it not.

The third is, that we take in good part our eſtate and condition, and content our ſelves with that which God ſendeth, whether it be much or little. He that is aſhamed of baſe and ſimple at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire, will be proud of gorgeous Apparel, if he may get it. We muſt learn therefore of the Apoſtle St. <hi>Paul</hi> both to uſe plenty,<note place="margin">Phi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

The <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> fourth and laſt Rule is, that every man behold and conſider his own vocation, in as much as God hath appointed every man his Degree and Office, within
<pb n="325" facs="tcp:54673:169"/> the limits whereof it behoveth him to keep himſelf. Therefore all may not look to wear like Apparel, but every one according to his degree, as God hath placed him. Which, if it were obſerved, many one doubtleſs ſhould be compelled to wear a ruſſet-coat, which now ruffleth in Silks and Velvets, ſpending more by the Year in ſumptuous Apparel, than their Fathers received for the whole Revenue of their Lands. But alas, now adays how many may we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold occupied wholly in pampering the fleſh, taking no care at all, but only how to deck themſelves, ſetting their affection altogether on worldly bravery, abuſing Gods goodneſs when he ſendeth plenty, to ſatisfie their wanton luſts, having no regard to the degree wherein God hath placed them.<note place="margin">Deut. 29.</note> The <hi>Iſraelites</hi> were contented with ſuch Apparel as God gave them, although it were baſe and ſimple. And God ſo bleſſed them, that their ſhoes and clothes laſted them forty years; yea, and thoſe clothes which their Fathers had worn, their Children were contented to uſe afterwards. But we are never contented, and therefore we proſper not; ſo that moſt commonly he that ruffleth in his Sables, in his fine furred Gown, corked Slippers, trim Buskins, and warm Mittons, is more ready to chill for cold, than the poor labour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing man, which can abide in the Field all the day long, when the North-wind blows, with a few beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerly clouts about him. We are loth to wear ſuch as our Fathers have left us, we think not that ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient or good enough for us. We muſt have one Gown for the day, another for the night; one long, another ſhort; one for Winter, another for Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer; one through-furred, another but faced; one for the working-day, another for the holy-day; one of this colour, another of that colour; one of Cloth, another of Silk or Damask. We muſt have change of Apparel, one afore Dinner, and another after; one of the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> faſhion, another <hi>Turky:</hi> and to be brief, never content with ſufficient.<note place="margin">Mat. 10.</note> Our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour Chriſt bade his Diſciples they ſhould not have

No leſs
<pb n="327" facs="tcp:54673:170"/> truly is the vanity that is uſed among us in theſe days. For the proud and haughty ſtomachs of the Daughters of <hi>England,</hi> are ſo maintained with di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers diſguiſed ſorts of coſtly Apparel,<note place="margin">Apolog. Con. gentes. c. <hi>6.</hi>
                        </note> that as <hi>Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tullian,</hi> an ancient Father, ſaith, there is left no difference in Apparel between an honeſt Matron and a common Strumpet. Yea, many men are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come ſo effeminate, that they care not what they ſpend in diſguiſing themſelves, ever deſiring new Toys, and inventing new Faſhions. Therefore a certain man that would picture every Country-man in his accuſtomed Apparel, when he had painted other Nations, he pictured the <hi>Engliſh</hi>-man all na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked, and gave him Cloth under his Arm, and bade him make it himſelf as he thought beſt, for he changed his Faſhion ſo often, that he knew not how to make it. Thus with our phantaſtical de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices, we make our ſelves laughing-ſtocks to other Nations; while one ſpendeth his Patrimony upon pounces and cuts, another beſtoweth more on a dancing ſhirt, than might ſuffice to buy him honeſt and comely Apparel for his whole Body. Some hang their Revenues about their necks, ruffling in their Ruffs, and many a one jeopardeth his beſt joynt, to maintain himſelf in ſumptuous Raiment. And every man, nothing conſidering his Eſtate and Condition, ſeeketh to excel other in coſtly attire. Whereby it cometh to paſs, that in abundance and plenty of all things, we yet complain of want and penury, while one man ſpendeth that which might ſerve a multitude, and no man diſtributeth of the abundance which he hath received, and all men ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſively waſte that which ſhould ſerve to ſupply the neceſſities of other. There hath been very good proviſion made againſt ſuch abuſes, by divers good and wholeſom Laws, which if they were practiſed as they ought to be of all true Subjects, they might in ſome part ſerve to diminiſh this raging and riotous exceſs in Apparel. But alas, there appeareth amongſt us little fear and obedience, either of God,
<pb n="328" facs="tcp:54673:171"/> or Man. Therefore muſt we needs look for Gods fearful vengeance from Heaven, to overthrow our preſumption and pride,<note place="margin">Acts 12.</note> as he overthrew <hi>Herod,</hi> who in his Royal Apparel, forgetting God, was ſmitten of an Angel, and eaten up of Worms. By which terrible Example, God hath taught us, that we are but Worms meat, although we pamper our ſelves never ſo much in gorgeous Apparel.</p>

But it will be hear objected and ſaid of ſome nice and vain Women, that all which we do in painting our faces, in dying our hair, in embalming our bodies, in decking us with gay apparel, is to pleaſe our Husbands, to delight his eyes, and to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain his love toward us.

We read in Hiſtories, that when King <hi>Dionyſius</hi> ſent to the Women of <hi>Lacedaemon</hi> rich Robes, they anſwered and ſaid, that they ſhall do us more ſhame than honour; and therefore refuſed them.

But perchance ſome dainty Dame will ſay and anſwer me, That they muſt do ſomething to ſhew their Birth and Blood, to ſhew their Husbands Riches: as though Nobility were chiefly ſeen by theſe things, which be common to thoſe which be moſt vile, as though thy Husbands Riches were not better beſtowed than in ſuch ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluities, as though when thou waſt chriſtened, thou didſt not renounce the pride of this World, and the pomp of the Fleſh. I ſpeak not againſt conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient Apparel for every ſtate agreeable; but againſt the ſuperfluity, againſt the vain delight to covet ſuch Vanities, to deviſe new Faſhions to feed thy Pride with, to ſpend ſo much upon thy Carkaſs, that thou and thy Husband are compelled to rob the Poor, to maintain thy coſtlineſs. Hear how that Noble, Holy Woman Queen <hi>Heſter,</hi> ſetteth out theſe goodly Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naments (as they be called) when (in reſpect of ſaving Gods People) ſhe was compelled to put on ſuch glorious Apparel, knowing that it was a fit ſtale to blind the Eyes of carnal Fools. Thus ſhe prayed, <hi>Thou knoweſt, O Lord, the neceſſity which I am driven to, to put on this apparel, and that I abhor this ſign of Pride, and of this glory which I bear on my head, and that I defie it as a filthy cloth, and that I wear it not when I am alone.</hi> Again, by what means was <hi>Holophernes</hi> deceived by the glittering ſhew of Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parel, which that Holy Woman <hi>Judith</hi> did put on her, not as delighting in them, nor ſeeking vain voluptuous pleaſure by them? But ſhe ware it of pure neceſſity by Gods diſpenſation, uſing this va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity to overcome the vain eyes of Gods Enemy. Such deſire was in thoſe Noble Women, being very loth and unwilling otherwiſe to wear ſuch ſumptuous Apparel, by the which others ſhould be cauſed to forget themſelves. Theſe be commended in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture for abhorring ſuch vanities, which by conſtraint and great neceſſity, againſt their hearts deſire, they were compelled to wear them for a time. And ſhall
<pb n="333" facs="tcp:54673:173"/> ſuch Women be worthy commendations, which nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther be comparable with theſe Women aforeſaid in Nobility, nor comparable to them in their good zeal to God and his People, whoſe daily delight and ſeeking is to flouriſh in ſuch gay ſhifts and changes, never ſatisfied, nor regarding who ſmarteth for their Apparel, ſo they may come by it? O vain men, which be ſubjects to their Wives in theſe inordinate affections! O vain Women, to procure ſo much hurt to themſelves, by the which they come the ſooner to miſery in this World, and in the mean time be abhorred of God, hated and ſcorned of wiſe men, and in the end, like to be joyned with ſuch, who in Hell, too late repenting themſelves, ſhall openly complain with theſe words: What hath our Pride profited us? or what profit hath the pomp of Riches brought us? All theſe things are paſſed away like a ſhadow. As for Vertue, we did never ſhew any ſign thereof: And thus we are conſumed in our wickedneſs. If thou ſaiſt that the Cuſtom is to be followed, and the uſe of the World doth com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel thee to ſuch curioſity: then I ask of thee, whoſe cuſtom ſhould be followed? Wiſe Folks manners, or Fools? If thou ſaiſt the Wiſe: then I ſay, follow them: For Fools Cuſtoms, who ſhould follow but Fools? Conſider that the Conſent of Wiſe men ought to be alledged for a Cuſtom. Now, if any lewd Cuſtom be uſed, be thou the firſt to break it, labour to diminiſh it and lay it down: and more laud before God, and more commendation ſhalt thou win by it, than by all the glory of ſuch ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluity.</p>
                     <p>Thus ye have heard declared unto you, what God requireth by his Word concerning the moderate uſe of his Creatures. Let us learn to uſe them mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately as he hath appointed. Almighty God hath taught us, to what end and purpoſe we ſhould uſe our Apparel. Let us therefore learn ſo to behave our ſelves in the uſe thereof, as becometh Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, always ſhewing our ſelves thankful to our
<pb n="334" facs="tcp:54673:174"/> Heavenly Father for his great and merciful benefits, who giveth unto us our daily Bread, that is to ſay, all things neceſſary for this our needy life: unto whom we ſhall render accounts for all his benefits, at the glorious appearing of our Saviour Chriſt: To whom with the Father, and the Holy Ghoſt, be all Honour, Praiſe, and Glory, for ever and ever. <hi>Amen.</hi>

For only by the help hereof, we attain to thoſe heavenly and everlaſting Treaſures, which God our Heavenly Father hath reſerved and laid up for his Children in his dear and well-beloved Son Jeſus Chriſt,<note place="margin">John 16.</note> with his Covenant and Promiſe moſt aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuredly confirmed and ſealed unto us, that if we ask, we ſhall receive.</p>

                     <p>Now, the great neceſſity of Prayer being ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently known, that our minds and hearts may be the more provoked and ſtirred thereunto, let us briefly conſider what wonderful ſtrength and power it hath to bring ſtrange and mighty things to paſs. We read in the Book of <hi>Exodus,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Exod. 1.</note> that <hi>Joſua</hi> fight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing againſt the <hi>Amalekites,</hi> did conquer and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come them, not ſo much by vertue of his own ſtrength, as by the earneſt and continual Prayer of <hi>Moſes,</hi> who, as long as he held up his hands to God, ſo long did Iſrael prevail; but when he fainted, and let his hands down, then did <hi>Amalek</hi> and his People prevail: Inſomuch that <hi>Aaron</hi> and <hi>Hur,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the Mount with him, were fain to ſtay up his hands until the going down of the Sun, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe had the People of God that day been utterly diſcomfited, and put to flight. Alſo we read in another place of <hi>Joſua</hi> himſelf,<note place="margin">Joſua 10.</note> how he at the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieging of <hi>Gibeon,</hi> making his humble Petition to Almighty God, cauſed the Sun and the Moon to ſtay their courſe, and to ſtand ſtill in the midſt of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven for the ſpace of a whole day, until ſuch time as the People were ſufficienly avenged upon their Enemies.</p>
                     <p>And was not <hi>Jehoſaphat</hi>'s Prayer of great force and ſtrength,<note place="margin">2 Par. 26.</note> when God at his requeſt cauſed his Enemies to fall out among themſelves, and wilfully to deſtroy one another? Who can marvel enough at the effect and vertue of <hi>Elias</hi> Prayer?<note place="margin">1 Kings 18.</note> He being a man ſubject to affections as we are, prayed to the Lord that it might not rain, and there fell no rain upon the Earth for the ſpace of three years and ſix months. Again, he prayed that it might rain, and there fell great plenty, ſo that the Earth brought forth her increaſe moſt abundantly.</p>
                     <p>It were too long to tell of <hi>Judith, Eſther, Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſanna,</hi> and of divers other godly Men and Women, how greatly they prevailed in all their doings, by giving their minds earneſtly and devoutly to Prayer. Let it be ſufficient at this time to conclude with
<pb n="338" facs="tcp:54673:176"/> the ſayings of <hi>Auguſtin</hi> and <hi>Chryſoſtom,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Aug. Ser. <hi>26.</hi> de temp. Chryſ. ſup. <hi>Mat. 22.</hi>
                        </note> whereof the one calleth Prayer the Key of Heaven, the other plainly affirmeth, that there is nothing in all the World more ſtrong than a man that giveth himſelf to fervent Prayer.</p>
                     <p>Now then, dearly Beloved, ſeeing Prayer is ſo needful a thing, and of ſo great ſtrength before God, let us, according as we are taught by the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of Chriſt and his Apoſtles, be earneſt and diligent in calling on the Name of the Lord. Let us never faint, never ſlack, never give over, but let us daily and hourly, early and late, in ſeaſon and out of ſeaſon, be occupied in Godly Meditations and Prayers: What if we obtain not our Petitions at the firſt? yet let us not be diſcouraged, yet let us continually cry and call upon God: he will ſurely hear us at length, if for no other cauſe, yet for very importunities ſake.<note place="margin">Luke 18.</note> Remember the Parable of the unrighteous Judge and the poor Widow, how ſhe by her importunate means cauſed him to do her Juſtice againſt her Adverſary, although otherwiſe he feared neither God nor man. <hi>Shall not God much more avenge his Elect</hi> (ſaith our Saviour Chriſt) <hi>which cry unto him day and night?</hi> Thus he taught his Diſciples, and in them all other true Chriſtian men, to Pray always, and never to faint or ſhrink. Remember alſo the example of the Woman of <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naan,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Mat 15.</note> how ſhe was rejected of Chriſt, and called Dog, as one moſt unworthy of any benefit at his hands: yet ſhe gave not over, but followed him ſtill, crying and calling upon him to be good and merciful unto her Daughter. And at length, by very importunity, ſhe obtained her requeſt. O let us learn by theſe examples, to be earneſt and fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent in Prayer, aſſuring our ſelves, that whatſoever we ask of God the Father in the Name of his Son Chriſt,<note place="margin">John 16.</note> and according to his will, he will undoubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly grant it. He is truth it ſelf, and as truly as he hath promiſed it, ſo truly will he perform it. God for his great mercies ſake, ſo work in our
<pb n="339" facs="tcp:54673:176"/> hearts by his Holy Spirit, that we may always make our humble Prayers unto him, as we ought to do, and always obtain the thing which we ask, through Jeſus Chriſt our Lord, to whom with the Father, and the Holy Ghoſt, be all Honour and Glory, World without end. Amen.</p>

                     <head>The Second Part of the Homily concerning PRAYER.</head>
                     <p>IN the Firſt Part of this Sermon, ye heard the great neceſſity, and alſo the great force of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vout and earneſt Prayer declared and proved unto you, both by divers weighty Teſtimonies, and alſo by ſundry good Examples of Holy Scripture. Now ſhall you learn whom you ought to call upon, and to whom you ought always to direct your Prayers. We are evidently taught in Gods Holy Teſtament, that Almighty God is the only Fountain and Well<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpring of all Goodneſs; and that whatſoever we have in this World, we receive it only at his hands: to this effect ſerveth the place of St. <hi>James,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">James 1.</note> 
                        <hi>Every good and perfect gift,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>cometh from above, and proceedeth from the Father of Lights.</hi> To this effect alſo ſerveth the Teſtimony of <hi>Paul,</hi> in divers places of his Epiſtles, witneſſing that the Spirit of Wiſdom, the Spirit of Knowledge and Revelation, yea, every good and heavenly gift, as Faith, Hope, Charity, Grace, and Peace, cometh only and ſolely of God. In conſideration whereof, he burſteth out into a ſudden Paſſion, and ſaith, <hi>O man,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">1 Cor. 4.</note> 
                        <hi>what thing haſt thou, which thou haſt not received?</hi> Therefore, whenſoever we need or lack any thing, pertaining either to the Body, or to the Soul, it behoveth us to run only unto God, who is the only giver of all good things. Our Saviour Chriſt in the Goſpel teaching his Diſciples how they ſhould Pray, ſendeth them to the Father in his Name, ſaying, <hi>Verily,
<pb n="340" facs="tcp:54673:177"/> verily,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">John 16. Matt. 6. Luke 11.</note> 
                        <hi>I ſay unto you, whatſoever ye ask the Father in my Name, he will give it unto you.</hi> And in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther place, <hi>When ye Pray, pray after this ſort: Our Father, which art in Heaven,</hi> &amp;c. And doth not God himſelf,<note place="margin">Pſal. 50. Acts 1.</note> by the mouth of his Prophet <hi>David,</hi> will and command us to call upon him? The Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle wiſheth Grace and Peace to all them that call on the Name of the Lord, and of his Son Jeſus Chriſt,<note place="margin">Joel 2.</note> as doth alſo the Prophet <hi>Joel,</hi> ſaying, <hi>And it ſhall come to paſs, that whoſoever ſhall call on the Name of the Lord, ſhall be ſaved.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Thus then it is plain by the infallible word of Truth and Life, that in all our neceſſities we muſt flee unto God, direct our Prayers unto him, call upon his Holy Name, deſire help at his hands, and at none others; whereof if we will yet have fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther reaſon, mark that which followeth. There are certain conditions moſt requiſite to be found in every ſuch a one as muſt be called upon, which if they be not found in him unto whom we pray, then doth our Prayer avail us nothing, but is alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether in vain.</p>
                     <p>The firſt is this, that he to whom we make our Prayers, be able to help us. The ſecond is, that he will help us. The third is, that he be ſuch a one as may hear our Prayers. The fourth is, that he underſtand better than we our ſelves what we lack, and how far we have need of help. If theſe things be to be found in any other ſaving only God, then may we lawfully call upon ſome other beſides God. But what man is ſo groſs, but he well under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtandeth that theſe things are only proper to him which is Omnipotent, and knoweth all things, even the very ſecrets of the Heart? that is to ſay, only and to God alone; whereof it followeth, that we muſt call neither upon Angel, nor yet upon Saint, but only and ſolely upon God,<note place="margin">Rom. 10.</note> as St. <hi>Paul</hi> doth write. <hi>How ſhall men call upon him in whom they have not believed?</hi> So that Invocation or Prayer, may not be made without Faith in him on whom
<pb n="341" facs="tcp:54673:177" rendition="simple:additions"/> they call; but that we muſt firſt believe in him, before we can make our Prayer unto him, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon we muſt only and ſolely Pray unto God. For to ſay that we ſhould believe either in Angel or Saint, or in any other living Creature, were meer horrible Blaſphemy againſt God and his Holy Word; neither ought this Fancy to enter into the Heart of any Chriſtian man, becauſe we are expreſly taught in the Word of the Lord only to repoſe our Faith in the Bleſſed Trinity, in whoſe only Name we are alſo Baptized, according to the expreſs Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of our Saviour <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Mat. 28.</note> in the laſt of St. <hi>Matthew.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But that the truth hereof may the better appear, even to them that be moſt ſimple and unlearned, let us conſider what Prayer is.<note place="margin">De ſpi. &amp; lit. cap. <hi>50.</hi> De ſummo bono, cap. <hi>8.</hi> lib. <hi>3.</hi>
                        </note> St. <hi>Auguſtin</hi> calleth it a lifting up of the mind to God; that is to ſay, an humble and lowly pouring out of the Heart to God. <hi>Iſidorus</hi> ſaith, that it is an affection of the Heart, and not a labour of the Lips. So that by theſe places, true Prayer doth conſiſt not ſo much in the outward ſound and voice of words, as in the inward groaning and crying of the Heart to God.</p>
                     <p>Now then, is there any Angel, any Virgin, any Patriarch or Prophet among the dead, that can un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand, or know the meaning of the Heart? The Scripture ſaith,<note place="margin">Pſal. 7. Apoc. 2. Jer. 17. 2 Par. 6.</note> It is God that ſearcheth the Heart and the Reins, and that he only knoweth the Hearts of the children of men.

                        <note place="margin">1 Tim. 2.</note> St. <hi>Paul</hi> alſo ſaith, <hi>There is one God, and one Mediator between God and man, even the man Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> Whereunto agreeth the Teſtimony of our Saviour himſelf,<note place="margin">John 14.</note> witneſſing that no man cometh to the Father, but only by him, who is the Way,<note place="margin">John 10.</note> the Truth, the Life, yea, and the only Door whereby we muſt enter into the Kingdom of Heaven, becauſe God is pleaſed in no other but in him. For which cauſe alſo he crieth, and calleth unto us that we ſhould come unto him,<note place="margin">Matt. 11.</note> ſaying, <hi>Come unto me all ye that labour and be heavy laden, and I ſhall refreſh you.</hi> Would Chriſt have us ſo neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily come unto him? and ſhall we moſt unthank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully leave him, and run unto other? This is even that which God ſo greatly complaineth of by his Prophet <hi>Jeremy,</hi> ſaying, <hi>My People have committed two great offences, they have forſaken me the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
<pb n="343" facs="tcp:54673:178"/> of the Waters of Life, and have digged to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves broken Pits, that can hold no Water.</hi> Is not that man, think you, unwiſe that will run for Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to a little Brook, when he may as well go to the head-ſpring? Even ſo may his Wiſdom be juſtly ſuſpected, that will flee unto Saints in time of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity, when he may boldly and without fear de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare his grief, and direct his Prayer unto the Lord himſelf. If God were ſtrange, or dangerous to be talked withal, then might we juſtly draw back and ſeek to ſome other.<note place="margin">Pſal. 145. Judith 9.</note> 
                        <hi>But the Lord is nigh unto all them that call upon him in Faith and Truth.</hi> And the Prayer of the humble and meek hath always pleaſed him. What if we be ſinners, ſhall we not therefore pray unto God? or ſhall we deſpair to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain any thing at his hands? Why did Chriſt then teach us to ask forgiveneſs of our ſins, ſaying, <hi>And forgive us our treſpaſſes, as we forgive them that treſpaſs againſt us?</hi> Shall we think that the Saints are more merciful in hearing ſinners, than God? <hi>David</hi> ſaith,<note place="margin">Pſal. 103.

                        <hi>that the Lord is full of compaſſion and mercy, ſlow to anger, and of great kindneſs.</hi> St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>that he is rich in mercy toward all them that call upon him.</hi> And he himſelf, by the mouth of his Prophet <hi>Eſay,</hi> ſaith,<note place="margin">Eſay 51.</note> 
                        <hi>For a little while have I forſaken thee, but with great compaſſion will I gather thee: For a moment in mine anger I have hid my face from thee, but with everlaſting mercy I have had compaſſion upon thee.</hi> Therefore the ſins of any man ought not to withhold him from Praying unto the Lord his God. But if he be truly penitent and ſtedfaſt in Faith, let him aſſure himſelf that the Lord will be merciful unto him, and hear his Prayers. O but I dare not (will ſome man ſay) trouble God at all times with my Prayers: We ſee that in Kings Houſes, and Courts of Princes, men cannot be admitted, unleſs they firſt uſe the help and means of ſome ſpecial Noble-man, to come to the ſpeech of the King, and to obtain the thing that they would have. To this reaſon doth
<pb n="344" facs="tcp:54673:179"/> St. <hi>Ambroſe</hi> anſwer very well,<note place="margin">Ambroſ. ſupper cap. <hi>1 Rom.</hi>
                        </note> writing upon the firſt Chapter to the <hi>Romans.</hi> Therefore (ſaith he) we uſe to go unto the King by Officers and Noble-men, becauſe the King is a Mortal man, and knoweth not to whom he may commit the Government of the Common-wealth. But to have God our Friend, from whom nothing is hid, we need not any helper, that ſhould further us with his good word, but only a devout and godly mind. And if it be ſo, that we need one to intreat for us, why may we not content our ſelves with that one Mediator,<note place="margin">Heb. 7.</note> which is at the right hand of God the Father, and there liveth for ever to make Interceſſion for us? As the Blood of Chriſt did Redeem us on the Croſs, and cleanſe us from our ſins; even ſo it is now able to ſave all them that come unto God by it. For Chriſt ſitting in Heaven, hath an everlaſting Prieſthood, and always prayeth to his Father for them that be Penitent, obtaining by vertue of his Wounds, which are evermore in the ſight of God, not only perfect remiſſion of our ſins, but alſo all other neceſſaries that we lack in this World; ſo that this only Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diator is ſufficient in Heaven, and needeth no others to help him.<note place="margin">Matt. 6. James 5. Coloſſ. 4. 1 Tim. 2.</note> Why then do we Pray one for ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in this Life, ſome man perchance will here de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand? Forſooth, we are willed ſo to do, by the expreſs Commandment both of Chriſt and his Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciples, to declare therein as well the Faith that we have in Chriſt towards God, as alſo the mutual Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity that we bear one towards another, in that we pity our Brothers caſe, and make our Humble Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition to God for him. But that we ſhould Pray unto Saints, neither have we any Commandment in all the Scripture, nor yet Example which we may ſafely follow. So that being done without Authority of Gods Word, it lacketh the ground of Faith, and therefore cannot be acceptable before God.<note place="margin">Hebr. 11. Rom. 14. Rom. 10.</note> 
                        <hi>For whatſoever is not of Faith, is ſin.</hi> And the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>that Faith cometh by hearing, and hearing by the Word of God.</hi> Yet thou wilt object further,
<pb n="345" facs="tcp:54673:179"/> that the Saints in Heaven do pray for us, and that their Prayer proceedeth of an earneſt Charity that they have towards their Brethren on Earth. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to it may be well anſwered; Firſt, that no man knoweth whether they do Pray for us, or no. And if any will go about to prove it by the nature of Charity, concluding, that becauſe they did pray for men on Earth, therefore they do much more the ſame now in Heaven. Then may it be ſaid by the ſame reaſon, that as oft as we do weep on Earth, they do alſo weep in Heaven, becauſe while they lived in this World, it is moſt certain and ſure they did ſo. And for that place which is written in the <hi>Apocalyps,</hi> namely, that the Angel did offer up the Prayers of the Saints upon the golden Altar: it is properly to be underſtood of thoſe Saints that are yet living on Earth, and not of them that are dead, otherwiſe what need were it that the Angel ſhould offer up their Prayers, being now in Heaven before the face of Almighty God? But admit the Saints do Pray for us, yet do we not know how, whether ſpecially for them which call upon them, or elſe generally for all men, wiſhing well to every man alike. If they Pray ſpecially for them which call upon them, then it is like they hear our Prayers, and alſo know our hearts deſire. Which thing to be falſe, it is already proved, both by the Scriptures, and alſo by the Authority of <hi>Auguſtin.</hi> Let us not therefore put our truſt or confidence in the Saints or Martyrs that be dead. Let us not call upon them, nor deſire help at their hands: but let us always lift up our Hearts to God, in the name of his dear Son Chriſt, for whoſe ſake as God hath promiſed to hear our Prayer, ſo he will truly perform it. Invo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation is a thing proper unto God, which if we attribute unto the Saints, it ſoundeth to their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach, neither can they well bear it at our hands. When <hi>Paul</hi> had healed a certain lame man,<note place="margin">Acts 14.</note> which was impotent in his Feet at <hi>Lyſtra,</hi> the People would have done Sacrifice unto him and <hi>Barnabas;</hi>
                        <pb n="346" facs="tcp:54673:180" rendition="simple:additions"/> who rending their clothes, refuſed it, and exhorted them to worſhip the true God. Likewiſe in the <hi>Revelation,</hi>

Which Examples declare unto us, that the Saints and Angels in Heaven will not have us to do any Honour unto them, that is due and proper unto God. He only is our Father, he only is Omnipotent, he only knoweth and underſtandeth all things, he only can help us at all times, and in all places, he ſuffereth the Sun to ſhine upon the good and the bad, he feedeth the young Ravens that cry unto him, he ſaveth both Man and Beaſt, he will not that any one hair of our Head ſhall periſh; but is always ready to help and preſerve all them that put their truſt in him, according as he hath promiſed,<note place="margin">Iſai 65.</note> ſaying, <hi>Before they call, I will anſwer, and whilſt they ſpeak, I will hear.</hi> Let us not therefore any thing miſtruſt his goodneſs, let us not fear to come before the Throne of his Mercy, let us not ſeek the aid and help of Saints, but let us come boldly our ſelves, nothing doubting but God for Chriſts ſake, in whom he is well pleaſed, will hear us without a Spokes-man, and accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſh our deſire in all ſuch things as ſhall be agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to his moſt Holy Will.<note place="margin">Chryſoſt. <hi>6</hi> hom. de profectu.

                     <head>The Third Part of the Homily concerning PRAYER.</head>
                     <p>YE were taught in the other part of this Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, unto whom ye ought to direct your Prayers in time of need and neceſſity, that is to wit, not unto Angels or Saints, but unto the eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal and everliving God, who becauſe he is merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, is always ready to hear us when we call upon him in true and perfect Faith. And becauſe he is Omnipotent, he can eaſily perform, and bring to paſs the thing that we requeſt to have at his hands. To doubt of his Power, it were a plain point of Infidelity, and clean againſt the Doctrine of the Holy Ghoſt, which teacheth us that he is all in all. And as touching his good will in this behalf, we have expreſs Teſtimonies in Scripture,<note place="margin">Pſal. 50.</note> how that he will help us, and alſo deliver us, if we call upon him in time of trouble. So that in both theſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects, we ought rather to call upon him than upon any other. Neither ought any man therefore to doubt to come boldly unto God, becauſe he is a ſinner. <hi>For the Lord</hi> (as the Prophet <hi>David</hi> ſaith) <hi>is gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious and merciful, yea,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Pſal. 107. 1 Tim. 1.</note> 
                        <hi>his mercy and goodneſs endu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth for ever.</hi> He that ſent his own Son into the World to ſave ſinners, will he not alſo hear ſinners, if with a true penitent Heart and a ſtedfaſt Faith they Pray unto him? Yea,<note place="margin">1 John 1.</note> 
                        <hi>if we acknowledge our ſins, God is faithful and juſt to forgive us our ſins, and to cleanſe us from all unrighteouſneſs,</hi> as we are plainly taught by the Examples of <hi>David, Peter, Mary Magdalen,</hi> the Publican, and divers others. And whereas we muſt needs uſe the help of ſome Mediator and Interceſſor, let us content our ſelves with him that is the true and only Mediator of the New Teſtament, namely, the Lord and Saviour Jeſus Chriſt. For as St. <hi>John</hi> ſaith, <hi>If any man ſin,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">1 John 2.</note>

                        <hi>we have an Advocate with the Father, Jeſus Chriſt the righteous, who is the Propitiation for our ſins.</hi> And St. <hi>Paul,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">1 Tim. 2.</note> in his firſt Epiſtle to <hi>Timothy,</hi> ſaith, <hi>There is one God, and one Mediator between God and man, even the man Jeſus Chriſt, who gave himſelf a ranſom for all men, to be a teſtimony in due time.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Now after this Doctrine eſtabliſhed, you ſhall be inſtructed for what kind of things, and what kind of perſons ye ought to make your Prayers unto God. It greatly behoveth all men, when they Pray, to conſider well and diligently with them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves what they ask and require at Gods hands, leſt if they deſire that thing which they ought not, their Petitions be made void, and of none effect. There came on a time unto <hi>Ageſilaus</hi> the King, a certain importunate ſuiter, who requeſted him in a matter earneſtly, ſaying, Sir, and it pleaſe your Grace, you did once promiſe me. Truth, quoth the King, if it be juſt that thou requireſt, then I promiſed thee, otherwiſe I did only ſpeak it, and not promiſe it. The man would not be ſo anſwered at the King's hand, but ſtill urging him more and more, ſaid, It becometh a King to perform the leaſt word he hath ſpoken, yea, if he ſhould only beck with his Head. No more, ſaith the King, than it behoveth one that cometh to a King, to ſpeak and ask thoſe things which are rightful and honeſt. Thus the King caſt off this unreaſonable and importunate ſuiter.</p>
                     <p>Now, if ſo great conſideration be to be had, when we kneel before an Earthly King, how much more ought to be had, when we kneel before the Heavenly King, who is only delighted with Juſtice and Equity, neither will admit any vain, fooliſh, or unjuſt Petition? Therefore it ſhall be good and profitable, throughly to conſider and determine with our ſelves, what things we may lawfully ask of God, without fear of repulſe, and alſo what kind of Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons we are bound to commend unto God in our daily Prayers. Two things are chiefly to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpected in every good and godly mans Prayer: His
<pb n="349" facs="tcp:54673:181"/> own neceſſity, and the glory of Almighty God. Neceſſity belongeth either outwardly to the Body, or elſe inwardly to the Soul. Which part of man, becauſe it is much more precious and excellent than the other, therefore we ought firſt of all, to crave ſuch things as properly belong to the ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion thereof: as the gift of Repentance, the gift of Faith, the gift of Charity and Good Works, Remiſſion and Forgiveneſs of Sins, Patience in Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſity, Lowlineſs in Proſperity,<note place="margin">Gal. 5.</note> and ſuch other like fruits of the Spirit; as Hope, Love, Joy, Peace, Long-ſuffering, Gentleneſs, Goodneſs, Meekneſs, and Temperance; which things God requireth of all them that profeſs themſelves to be his Children, ſaying unto them in this wiſe,<note place="margin">Matt. 5.</note> 
                        <hi>Let your light ſo ſhine before men, that they may ſee your good works, and glorifie your Father which is in Heaven.</hi> And in another place alſo he ſaith,<note place="margin">Matt. 6.</note> 
                        <hi>Seek ye firſt the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of God, and his Righteouſneſs, and then all other things ſhall be given unto you.</hi> Wherein he putteth us in mind, that our chief and greateſt care ought to be for thoſe things which pertain to the health and ſafeguard of the Soul,<note place="margin">Hebr. 13.</note> becauſe <hi>we have here</hi> (as the Apoſtle ſaith) <hi>no continuing City, but we ſeek after another in the World to come.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Now, when we have ſufficiently prayed for things belonging to the Soul, then may we lawfully, and with ſafe Conſcience, Pray alſo for our bodily Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſities; as Meat, Drink, Clothing, Health of Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, deliverance out of Priſon, good luck in our daily Affairs, and ſo forth, according as we ſhall have need. Whereof,<note place="margin">Matt. 6. Luke 11.</note> what better Example can we deſire to have, than of Chriſt himſelf, who taught his Diſciples, and all other Chriſtian men, firſt to pray for Heavenly things, and afterward for Earthly things, as is to be ſeen in that Prayer which he left unto his Church, commonly called the Lords Prayer? In the third Book of <hi>Kings,</hi> and third Chapter, it is written, <hi>That God appeared by night in a dream unto</hi> Solomon <hi>the King, ſaying, Ask of
<pb n="350" facs="tcp:54673:182"/> me whatſoever thou wilt, and I will give it thee. Solomon</hi> made his Humble Prayer, and asked a wiſe and prudent Heart, that might judge and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand what were good, and what were ill; what were godly, and what were ungodly; what were righteous, and what were unrighteous in the ſight of the Lord. <hi>It pleaſed God wondrouſly, that he had asked this thing, And God ſaid unto him, Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe thou haſt requeſted this word, and haſt not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired many days, and long years upon the Earth, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther abundance of Riches and Goods, nor yet the life of thine Enemies which hate thee, but haſt deſired Wiſdom to ſit in Judgment; behold, I have done un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to thee according to thy words; I have given thee a wiſe heart, full of knowledge and underſtanding, ſo that there was never any like thee before time, neither ſhall be in time to come. Moreover, I have beſides this, given thee that which thou haſt not required, namely, worldly wealth and riches, Princely honour and glory, ſo that thou ſhalt therein alſo paſs all Kings that ever were.</hi> Note this Example, how <hi>Solomon</hi> being put to his choice to ask of God whatſoever he would, requeſted not vain and tranſitory things, but the high and Heavenly Treaſures of Wiſdom; and that in ſo doing, he obtaineth as it were in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compence, both Riches and Honour. Wherein is given us to underſtand, that in our daily Prayers, we ſhould chiefly and principally ask thoſe things which concern the Kingdom of God, and the Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of our own Souls, nothing doubting but all other things ſhall (according to the promiſe of Chriſt) be given unto us. But here we muſt take heed that we forget not that other end whereof mention was made before, namely, the Glory of God. Which unleſs we mind, and ſet before our Eyes in making our Prayers, we may not look to be heard, or to receive any thing of the Lord. In the xx. Chapter of <hi>Matthew,</hi> the Mother of the two Sons of <hi>Zebedee</hi> came unto Jeſus, worſhipping him, and ſaying, <hi>Grant that my two Sons may ſit
<pb n="351" facs="tcp:54673:182"/> in thy Kingdom, the one on thy right hand, and the other at thy left hand.</hi> In this Petition ſhe did not reſpect the Glory of God, but plainly declared the ambition and vain-glory of her own mind, for which cauſe ſhe was alſo moſt worthily repelled, and rebuked at the Lords hand. In like manner we read in the <hi>Acts,</hi> of one <hi>Simon Magus,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Acts 8.</note> a Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerer, <hi>how that he perceiving that through laying on of the Apoſtles hands the Holy Ghoſt was given, offered them money, ſaying, Give me alſo this power, that on whomſoever I lay my hands, he may receive the Holy Ghoſt.</hi> In making this Requeſt, he ſought not the Honour and Glory of God, but his own private Gain and Lucre, thinking to get great ſtore of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney by this feat, and therefore it was juſtly ſaid un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him, <hi>Thy money periſh with thee, becauſe thou think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt that the gift of God may be obtained with money.</hi> By theſe and ſuch other Examples we are taught, whenſoever we make our Prayers unto God, chiefly to reſpect the Honour and Glory of his Name. Whereof we have this general Precept in the Apoſtle <hi>Paul,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">1 Cor. 10. Coloſſ. 3. Mat. 26. Luke 22.</note> 
                        <hi>Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ye eat or drink, or whatſoever ye do, look that ye do it to the glory of God.</hi> Which thing we ſhall beſt of all do, if we follow the example of our Saviour Chriſt, who praying that the bitter Cup of Death might paſs from him, would not therein have his own will fulfilled, but referred the whole matter to the good will and pleaſure of his Father.</p>
                     <p>And hitherto concerning thoſe things, that we may lawfully and boldly ask of God.</p>
                     <p>Now it followeth, that we declare what kind of Perſons we are bound in Conſcience to pray for. St. <hi>Paul</hi> writing to <hi>Timothy,</hi>

                        </note> exhorteth him to make Prayers and Supplications for all men, exempting none, of what degree or ſtate ſoever they be. In which place he maketh mention by name of Kings and Rulers which are in Authority, putting us there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by to acknowledge how greatly it concerneth the profit of the Common-wealth, to pray diligently for the Higher Powers. Neither is it without good
<pb n="352" facs="tcp:54673:183"/> cauſe, that he doth ſo often in all his Epiſtles crave the Prayers of Gods People for himſelf.<note place="margin">Coloſ. 4. Rom. 15. 2 Theſſ. 3.</note> For in ſo doing, he declareth to the World how expedient and needful it is daily to call upon God for the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters of his Holy Word and Sacraments, that they may have the door of utterance oppened unto them,<note place="margin">Epheſ. 6.</note> that they may truly underſtand the Scriptures, that they may effectually Preach the ſame unto the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and bring forth the true Fruits thereof, to the Example of all other.</p>
                     <p>After this ſort did the Congregation continually Pray for <hi>Peter</hi> at <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Acts 12.</note> and for <hi>Paul</hi> among the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> to the great increaſe and furtherance of Chriſts Goſpel. And if we, following their good Example herein, will ſtudy to do the like, doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs it cannot be expreſſed how greatly we ſhall both help our ſelves, and alſo pleaſe God.</p>
                     <p>To diſcourſe and run through all degrees of Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons it were too long. Therefore ye ſhall briefly take this one concluſion for all; Whomſoever we are bound by expreſs Commandment to love, for thoſe alſo are we bound in Conſcience to pray. But we are bound by expreſs Commandment to love all men as our ſelves: therefore we are alſo bound to Pray for all men, even as well as if it were for our ſelves, notwithſtanding we know them to be our extream and deadly Enemies: For ſo doth our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour Chriſt plainly teach us in his Goſpel, ſaying, <hi>Love your enemies,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Matt. 5.</note> 
                        <hi>bleſs them that curſe you, do good to them that hate you, pray for them that perſecute you, that ye may be the children of your Father which is in Heaven.</hi> And as he taught his Diſciples, ſo did he practice himſelf in his life-time,<note place="margin">Luke 23.</note> praying for his Enemies upon the Croſs, and deſiring his Father to forgive them, becauſe they knew not what they did. As did alſo that Holy and bleſſed Martyr <hi>Stephen,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Acts 7.</note> when he was cruelly ſtoned to death of the ſtub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>born and ſtiff-necked Jews; to the example of all them that will truly and unfeignedly follow their Lord and Maſter Chriſt in this miſerable and mortal life.</p>
                     <pb n="353" facs="tcp:54673:183"/>
                     <p>Now, to entreat of that Queſtion, whether we ought to pray for them that are departed out of this World, or no? Wherein, if we will cleave only unto the Word of God, then muſt we needs grant, that we have no Commandment ſo to do. For the Scripture doth acknowledge but two places after this life. The one proper to the Elect and Bleſſed of God, the other to the Reprobate and Damned Souls, as may be well gathered by the Parable of <hi>Lazarus</hi> and the Rich man:<note place="margin">Luke 16. <hi>Lib.</hi> 2. <hi>Evang. quaeſt.</hi> 1. <hi>cap.</hi> 38.</note> which place St. <hi>Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtine</hi> expounding, ſaith in this wiſe; That which <hi>Abraham</hi> ſpeaketh unto the Rich man in <hi>Lukes</hi> Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel, namely, that the Juſt cannot go into thoſe places where the Wicked are tormented: what other thing doth it ſignifie, but only this, that the juſt, by reaſon of Gods Judgment, which may not be revoked, can ſhew no deed of Mercy in helping them which after this life are caſt into Priſon, until they pay the uttermoſt farthing? Theſe words, as they confound the Opinion of helping the dead by Prayer, ſo they do clean confute and take away the vain Error of Purgatory, which is grounded upon the ſaying of the Goſpel, <hi>Thou ſhalt not depart thence, until thou haſt paid the uttermoſt farthing.</hi> Now doth St. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> ſay, that thoſe men which are caſt into Priſon after this life, on that condition, may in no wiſe be holpen, though we would help them never ſo much. And why? Becauſe the Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of God is unchangeable, and cannot be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voked again. Therefore let us not deceive our ſelves, thinking that either we may help other, or other may help us by their good and charitable Prayers in time to come. For as the Preacher ſaith, <hi>When the tree falleth, whether it be toward the South,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Eccleſ. 11.</note> 
                        <hi>or toward the North, in what place ſoever the tree falleth, there it lieth:</hi> meaning thereby, that every mortal man dieth either in the ſtate of Salvation or Damnation, according as the words of the Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geliſt <hi>John</hi> do alſo plainly import, ſaying,<note place="margin">John 3.</note> 
                        <hi>He that believeth on the Son of God, hath eternal life: But he
<pb n="354" facs="tcp:54673:184"/> that believeth not on the Son, ſhall never ſee life, but the wrath of God abideth upon him.</hi> Where is then the third place, which they call Purgatory? or where ſhall our Prayers help and profit the dead?<note place="margin">Lib. <hi>5.</hi> Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pogno. Chry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoſt. in Heb. <hi>2.</hi> Homil. <hi>5.</hi> in Cyprian. contra De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metrianum.</note> St. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> doth only acknowledge two places after this life, Heaven and Hell. As for the third place, he doth plainly deny that there is any ſuch to be found in all Scripture. <hi>Chryſoſtom</hi> likewiſe is of this mind, that unleſs we waſh away our ſins in this preſent World, we ſhall find no comfort afterward. And St. <hi>Cyprian</hi> ſaith, that after death, Repentance and Sorrow of pain ſhall be with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out fruit, Weeping alſo ſhall be in vain, and Prayer ſhall be to no purpoſe. Therefore he counſelleth all men to make proviſion for themſelves while they may, becauſe when they are once departed out of this life, there is no place for Repentance, nor yet for ſatisfaction.</p>
                     <p>Let theſe and ſuch other places be ſufficient to take away the groſs Error of Purgatory out of our Heads, neither let us dream any more, that the Souls of the dead are any thing at all holpen by our Prayers: But as the Scripture teacheth us, let us think that the Soul of man paſſing out of the Body, goeth ſtraightways either to Heaven, or elſe to Hell, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of the one needeth no Prayer, the other is without Redemption. The only Purgatory wherein we muſt truſt to be ſaved, is the death and blood of Chriſt, which if we apprehend with a true and ſtedfaſt Faith, it purgeth and cleanſeth us from all our ſins, even as well as if he were now hanging upon the Croſs. <hi>The blood of Chriſt,</hi>

<pb n="355" facs="tcp:54673:184"/> whole truſt and confidence, nothing doubting, but if they truly repent them of their ſins, and die in perfect Faith, that then they ſhall forthwith paſs from death to life. If this kind of purgation will not ſerve them, let them never hope to be releaſed by other mens Prayers, though they ſhould continue therein unto the Worlds end. He that cannot be ſaved by Faith in Chriſts Blood, how ſhall he look to be delivered by mans Interceſſions? Hath God more reſpect to man on Earth, than he hath to Chriſt in Heaven?<note place="margin">1 John 2.</note> 
                        <hi>If any man ſin</hi> (ſaith St. <hi>John) we have an Advocate with the Father, even Jeſus Chriſt the righteous, and he is the propitiation for our ſins.</hi> But we muſt take heed that we call upon this Advocate while we have ſpace given us in this life, leſt when we are once dead, there be no hope of Salvation left unto us. For as every man ſleepeth with his own cauſe, ſo every man ſhall riſe again with his own cauſe. And look in what ſtate he dieth, in the ſame ſtate he ſhall be alſo judged, whether it be to Salvation or Damnation. Let us not therefore dream either of Purgatory, or of Prayer for the Souls of them that be dead: but let us earneſtly and diligently pray for them which are expreſly commanded in Holy Scripture, namely, for Kings and Rulers, for Miniſters of Gods Holy Word and Sacraments, for the Saints of this World, otherwiſe called the Faithful: to be ſhort, for all men living, be they never ſo great Enemies to God and his Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, as <hi>Jews, Turks, Pagans, Infidels, Hereticks,</hi> &amp;c. Then ſhall we truly fulfil the Commandment of God in that behalf, and plainly declare our ſelves to be the true Children of our Heavenly Father, who ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fereth the Sun to ſhine upon the good and the bad, and the rain to fall upon the juſt and the unjuſt. For which, and all other benefits moſt abundantly beſtowed upon mankind from the beginning, let us give him hearty thanks, as we are moſt bound, and praiſe his Name for ever and ever. Amen.</p>

And although we ought at all times, and in all places to have in remembrance, and to be thankful to our gracious Lord, according as it is written,<note place="margin">Pſal. 103.</note> 
                        <hi>I will magnifie the Lord at all times.</hi> And again, <hi>Whereſoever the Lord beareth rule, O my Soul
<pb n="357" facs="tcp:54673:185"/> praiſe the Lord:</hi> Yet it appeareth to be Gods good will and pleaſure, that we ſhould at ſpecial times, and in ſpecial places, gather our ſelves together, to the intent his Name might be renowned, and his glory ſet forth in the Congregation and Aſſembly of his Saints. As concerning the time which Almighty God hath appointed his People to aſſemble together ſolemnly, it doth appear by the fourth Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of God: <hi>Remember,</hi> ſaith God, <hi>that thou keep holy the Sabbath Day.</hi> Upon the which day, as is plain in the <hi>Acts</hi> of the Apoſtles,<note place="margin">Acts 13.</note> the People ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſtomably reſorted together, and heard diligently the Law and the Prophets read among them. And albeit this Commandment of God doth not bind Chriſtian People ſo ſtraitly to obſerve and keep the utter Ceremonies of the Sabbath day, as it was given unto the Jews, as touching the forbearing of work and labour in time of great neceſſity, and as touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the preciſe keeping of the Seventh day, after the manner of the Jews. For we keep now the Firſt day, which is our Sunday, and make that our Sabbath, that is, our day of Reſt, in the honour of our Saviour Chriſt, who as upon that day roſe from death, conquering the ſame moſt triumphantly: Yet notwithſtanding, whatſoever is found in the Commandment appertaining to the Law of Nature, as a thing moſt godly, moſt juſt, and needful for the ſetting forth of Gods glory, it ought to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained and kept of all good Chriſtian People. And therefore by this Commandment, we ought to have a time, as one day in the Week, wherein we ought to reſt, yea, from our lawful and needful works. For like as it appeareth by this Commandment, that no man in the ſix days ought to be ſlothful or idle, but diligently to labour in that ſtate wherein God hath ſet him: Even ſo, God hath given expreſs charge to all men, that upon the Sabbath day, which is now our Sunday, they ſhould ceaſe from all weekly and work-day labour, to the intent that like as God himſelf wrought ſix days, and reſted the ſeventh,
<pb n="358" facs="tcp:54673:186"/> and bleſſed, and ſanctified it, and conſecrated it to quietneſs and reſt from labour: even ſo Gods obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient People ſhould uſe the Sunday holily, and reſt from their common and daily buſineſs, and alſo give themſelves wholly to Heavenly Exerciſes of Gods true Religion and Service. So that God doth not only command the obſervation of this Holy Day, but alſo by his own example doth ſtir and provoke us to the diligent keeping of the ſame. Good na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Children will not only become obedient to the Commandment of their Parents, but alſo have a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent Eye to their doings, and gladly follow the ſame. So if we will be the Children of our Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Father, we muſt be careful to keep the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Sabbath day, which is the Sunday, not only for that it is Gods expreſs Commandment, but alſo to declare our ſelves to be loving Children, in fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing the example of our gracious Lord and Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
                     <p>Thus it may plainly appear, that Gods Will and Commandment was to have a ſolemn time and ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing day in the Week, wherein the People ſhould come together and have in remembrance his won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful benefits, and to render him thanks for them, as appertaineth to loving, kind, and obedient Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. This Example and Commandment of God, the godly Chriſtian People began to follow imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately after the Aſcenſion of our Lord Chriſt, and began to chuſe them a ſtanding day of the Week to come together in: Yet not the ſeventh day, which the Jews kept; but the Lords day, the day of the Lords Reſurrection, the day after the ſeventh day, which is the firſt day of the Week. Of the which day mention is made by St. <hi>Paul</hi> on this wiſe.<note place="margin">1 Cor. 16.</note> 
                        <hi>In the firſt day of the Sabbath, let every man lay up what he thinketh good;</hi> meaning for the Poor. By the firſt day of the Sabbath, is meant our Sunday, which is the firſt day after the Jews ſeventh day. And in the <hi>Apocalyps</hi> it is more plain, whereas St. <hi>John</hi> ſaith, <hi>I was in the Spirit upon the Lords day.</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Apoc. 1.</note> Sithence
<pb n="359" facs="tcp:54673:186"/> which time Gods People hath always, in all Ages, without any gain-ſaying, uſed to come together up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Sunday,<note place="margin">Numb. 15.</note> to celebrate and honour the Lords bleſſed Name, and carefully to keep that day in Holy reſt and quietneſs, both Man, Woman, Child, Servant, and Stranger. For the tranſgreſſion and breach of which day, God hath declared himſelf much to be grieved, as it may appear by him, who for gathering of ſticks on the Sabbath day, was ſtoned to death. But alas, all theſe notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, it is lamentable to ſee the wicked boldneſs of thoſe that will be counted Gods People, who paſs nothing at all of keeping and hallowing the Sunday. And theſe People are of two ſorts. The one ſort, if they have any buſineſs to do, though there be no extream need, they muſt not ſpare for the Sunday, they muſt ride and journey on the Sunday, they muſt drive and carry on the Sunday; they muſt row and ferry on the Sunday, they muſt buy and ſell on the Sunday, they muſt keep Markets and Fairs on the Sunday: finally, they uſe all days alike, Work-days and Holy-days all are one. The other ſort is worſe. For although they will not Travel nor Labour on the Sunday as they do on the Week-day, yet they will not reſt in Holineſs, as God com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandeth; but they reſt in ungodlineſs and filthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, prancing in their Pride, pranking and prick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, pointing and painting themſelves to be gorge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and gay: they reſt in exceſs and ſuperfluity, in gluttony and drunkenneſs, like Rats and Swine: they reſt in brawling and railing, in quarrelling and fighting: they reſt in wantonneſs, in toyiſh talking, in filthy fleſhlineſs, ſo that it doth too evidently ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear that God is more diſhonoured, and the Devil better ſerved on the Sunday than upon all the days in the Week beſides And I aſſure you, the Beaſts which are commanded to reſt on the Sunday, ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour God better than this kind of People: For they offend not God, they break not their Holy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>days. Wherefore, O ye People of God, lay your
<pb n="360" facs="tcp:54673:187"/> hands upon your hearts, repent and amend this grievous and dangerous wickedneſs, ſtand in awe of the Commandment of God, gladly follow the example of God himſelf, be not diſobedient to the godly Order of Chriſts Church, uſed and kept from the Apoſtles time until this day. Fear the diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure and juſt Plagues of Almighty God, if ye be negligent and forbear not labouring and travelling on the Sabbath day or Sunday, and do not reſort together to celebrate and magnifie Gods bleſſed Name, in quiet Holineſs and godly Reverence.</p>
                     <p>Now concerning the Place where the People of God ought to reſort together, and where eſpecially they ought to celebrate and ſanctifie the Sabbath day, that is, the Sunday, the day of Holy Reſt. That Place is called Gods Temple, or the Church, becauſe the Company and Congregation of Gods People (which is properly called the Church) doth there aſſemble themſelves on the days appointed for ſuch Aſſemblies and Meetings. And foraſmuch as Almighty God hath appointed a ſpecial time to be honoured in, it is very meet, godly, and alſo ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary that there ſhould be a Place appointed where theſe People ſhould meet and reſort, to ſerve their gracious God and merciful Father. Truth it is, the Holy Patriarchs, for a great number of years, had neither Temple nor Church to reſort unto. The cauſe was, they were not ſtaid in any place, but were in a continual peregrination and wandring, that they could not conveniently build any Church. But ſo ſoon as God had delivered his People from their Enemies, and ſet them in ſome liberty in the Wilderneſs, he ſet them up a coſtly and a curious Tabernacle, which was as it were the Pariſh Church, a place to reſort unto of the whole multitude, a place to have his Sacrifices made in, and other Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervances and Rites to be uſed in. Furthermore, after that God, according to the truth of his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, had placed and quietly ſetled his People in the Land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> now called <hi>Jury,</hi> he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
<pb n="361" facs="tcp:54673:187"/> a great and magnificent Temple to be built by King <hi>Solomon,</hi> as ſeldom the like hath been ſeen: a Temple ſo decked and adorned, ſo gorgeouſly garniſhed, as was meet and expedient for People of that time, which would be allured and ſtirred with nothing ſo much, as with ſuch outward goodly gay things. This was now the Temple of God, endued alſo with many gifts and ſundry promiſes. This was the publick Church, and the Mother-Church of all <hi>Jury.</hi> Here was God honoured and ſerved. Hither was the whole Realm of all the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> bound to come at three Solemn Feaſts in the Year, to ſerve their Lord God here. But let us proceed further. In the time of Chriſt and his Apoſtles, there were yet no Temples nor Churches for Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian men. For why? they were always for the moſt part in perſecution, vexation, and trouble, ſo that there could be no liberty nor licence obtained for that purpoſe. Yet God delighted much that they ſhould often reſort together in a place, and therefore after his aſcenſion they remained together, in an Upper Chamber, ſometime they entred into the Temple, ſometime into the Synagogues, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times they were in Priſon, ſometimes in their Houſes, ſometimes in the Fields, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And this continued ſo long till the Faith of Chriſt Jeſus be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to multiply in a great part of the World. Now, when divers Realms were eſtabliſhed in Gods true Religion, and God had given them peace and quietneſs, then began Kings, Noble-men, and the People alſo, ſtirred up with a godly zeal and fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventneſs, to build up Temples and Churches, whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the People might reſort, the better to do their Duty towards God, and to keep Holy their Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath day, the day of Reſt. And to theſe Temples have the Chriſtians cuſtomably uſed to reſort from time to time, as unto meet places where they might with common conſent praiſe and magnifie Gods name, yielding him thanks for the benefits that he daily poureth upon them, both mercifully and
<pb n="362" facs="tcp:54673:188"/> abundantly, where they might alſo hear his Holy Word read, expounded, and preached ſincerely; and receive his Holy Sacraments miniſtred unto them duly and purely. True it is, that the chief and ſpecial Temples of God, wherein he hath greateſt pleaſure, and moſt delighteth to dwell, are the bodies and minds of true Chriſtians, and the choſen People of God, according to the Doctrine of Holy Scriptures, declared by St. <hi>Paul. Know ye not</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>that ye be the Temple of God,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">1 Cor. 3.</note> 
                        <hi>and that the Spirit of God doth dwell in you?</hi> The Temple of God is Holy, which ye are. And again in the ſame Epiſtle,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 6.</note> 
                        <hi>Know ye not that your body is the Temple of the Holy Ghoſt dwelling in you, whom you have given you of God, and that ye be not your own?</hi> Yet this notwithſtanding, God doth allow the material Temple made with Lime and Stone (ſo oft as his People come together into it, to praiſe his Holy Name) to be his Houſe, and the place where he hath promiſed to be preſent, and where he will hear the Prayers of them that call upon him. The which thing both Chriſt and his Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles, with all the reſt of the Holy Fathers, do ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently declare by this: That albeit they certainly knew that their Prayers were heard in what place ſoever they made them, though it were in Caves, in Woods, and in Deſarts, yet (ſo oft as they could conveniently) they reſorted to the material Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, there with the reſt of the Congregation, to joyn in Prayer and true Worſhip.</p>
                     <p>Wherefore (dearly beloved) you that profeſs your ſelves to be Chriſtians, and glory in that name, diſdain not to follow the example of your Maſter Chriſt, whoſe Scholars you ſay you be, ſhew you to be like them whoſe School-mates you take upon you to be; that is, the Apoſtles and Diſciples of Chriſt. Lift up pure hands, with clean hearts, in all places, and at all times. But do the ſame in the Temples and Churches upon the Sabbath days alſo. Our godly Predeceſſors, and the ancient
<pb n="363" facs="tcp:54673:188"/> Fathers of the Primitive Church, ſpared not their Goods to build Churches; no, they ſpared not their Lives in time of Perſecution, and to hazard their Blood, that they might aſſemble themſelves toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in Churches. And ſhall we ſpare a little la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour to come to Churches? Shall neither their Example, nor our Duty, nor the Commodities (that thereby ſhould come unto us) move us? If we will declare our ſelves to have the fear of God, if we will ſhew our ſelves true Chriſtians, if we will be the followers of Chriſt our Maſter, and of thoſe godly Fathers that have lived before us, and now have received the Reward of true and faithful Chriſtians, we muſt both willingly, earneſtly, and reverently come unto the material Churches and Temples to Pray, as unto fit places appointed for that uſe, and that upon the Sabbath day, as at moſt convenient time for Gods People, to ceaſe from bodily and worldly buſineſs, to give themſelves to Holy Reſt, and Godly Contemplation pertaining to the Service of Almighty God: Whereby we may reconcile our ſelves to God, be partakers of his Holy Sacraments, and be devout hearers of his Holy Word, ſo to be eſtabliſhed in Faith to Godward, in Hope againſt all Adverſity, and in Charity to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward our Neighbours. And thus running our courſe as good Chriſtian People, we may at the laſt attain the Reward of everlaſting Glory, through the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits of our Saviour Jeſus Chriſt: To whom with the Father, and the Holy Ghoſt, be all Honour and Glory. Amen.</p>

Secondly, how ſore God is grieved with them that do deſpiſe, or little regard to come to the Church upon the Holy reſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Day. It may well appear by the Scriptures, that many of the godly <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> being now in Captivity for their ſins among the <hi>Babylonians,</hi> full often wiſhed and deſired to be again at <hi>Jeruſalem.</hi> And at their return, through Gods goodneſs (though many of the People were negligent) yet the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers were marvellous devout to build up the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, that Gods People might repair thither, to ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour him. And King <hi>David,</hi> when he was a ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed man out of his Countrey, out of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> the Holy City, from the Sanctuary, from the Holy place, and from the Tabernacle of God: What de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire, what ferventneſs was in him toward that Holy place? what wiſhings and prayers made he to God to be a Dweller in the Houſe of the Lord? <hi>One thing</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>have I asked of the Lord, and this will I ſtill crave, that I may reſort and have my dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling in the Houſe of the Lord, ſo long as I live.</hi> Again, <hi>O how I joyed when I heard theſe words?

                        <note place="margin">Pſal. 122.</note> And in other places of the <hi>Pſalms</hi> he declareth for what intent and purpoſe he hath ſuch a fervent deſire to enter into the Temple and Church of the Lord: <hi>I will fall down</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>and worſhip in the holy Temple of the Lord.</hi> Again,<note place="margin">Pſal. 63.</note>

Thirdly, there he would praiſe the Name of God, with all the Congregation and Company of the People. Theſe conſiderations of this bleſſed Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet of God ought to ſtir up, and kindle in us the like earneſt deſire to reſort to the Church, eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally upon the holy reſtful days, there to do our Duties, and to ſerve God, there to call to remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance how God, even of his meer mercy, and for the glory of his Name ſake, worketh mightily to conſerve us in Health, Wealth, and Godlineſs, and mightily preſerveth us from the aſſaults and rages of our fierce and cruel Enemies, and there joyfully in the number of his faithful People to praiſe and magnifie the Lords Holy Name.</p>

                        <hi>named</hi> Simeon, <hi>a juſt man, fearing God: he came by the ſpirit of God into the Temple, and was told by the ſame ſpirit, that he ſhould not die before he ſaw the anointed of the Lord.</hi> In the Temple his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe was fulfilled, in the Temple he ſaw Chriſt, and took him in his Arms, in the Temple he brake out into the mighty praiſe of God his Lord. <hi>Anna a Propheteſs, an old Widow, departed out of the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, giving her ſelf to Prayer and Faſting day and night: And ſhe coming about the ſame time, was likewiſe inſpired, and confeſſed, and ſpake of the Lord to all them that looked for the Redemption of</hi> Iſrael. This bleſſed Man, and this bleſſed Woman were not diſappointed of wonderful Fruit, Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modity, and Comfort, which God ſent them, by
<pb n="366" facs="tcp:54673:190"/> their diligent reſorting to Gods Holy Temple. Now ye ſhall hear how grievouſly God hath been offend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with his People, for that they paſſed ſo little upon his Holy Temple, and foulely either deſpiſed or abuſed the ſame. Which thing may plainly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear by the notable Plagues and Puniſhments which God hath laid upon his People; eſpecially in this, that he ſtirred up their Adverſaries horribly to beat down, and utterly to deſtroy his Holy Temple with a perpetual deſolation. Alas, how many Churches, Countries, and Kingdoms of Chriſtian People, have of late years been plucked down, and over-run, and left waſte, with grievous and intolerable Tyranny and Cruelty of the Enemy of our Lord Chriſt, the Great <hi>Turk,</hi> who hath ſo univerſally ſcourged the Chriſtians, that never the like was heard or read of? Above thirty years paſt, the Great <hi>Turk</hi> had over-run, conquered, and brought into his Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion and Subjection, twenty Chriſtian Kingdoms, turning away the People from the Faith of Chriſt, poiſoning them with the deviliſh Religion of wicked <hi>Mahomet;</hi> and either deſtroying their Churches ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly, or filthily abuſing them with their wicked and deteſtable Errors. And now this Great <hi>Turk,</hi> this bitter and ſharp Scourge of Gods Vengeance, is even at hand in this part of Chriſtendom, in <hi>Europe,</hi> at the Borders of <hi>Italy,</hi> at the Borders of <hi>Germany,</hi> greedily gaping to devour us, to over-run our Country, to deſtroy our Churches alſo, unleſs we repent our ſinful life, and reſort more diligently to the Church to honour God, to learn his bleſſed Will, and to fulfil the ſame. The <hi>Jews</hi> in their time provoked juſtly the vengeance of God, for that partly they abuſed his Holy Temple with the deteſtable Idolatry of the Heathen, and ſuperſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious Vanities of their own Inventions, contrary to Gods Commandment, partly they reſorted unto it as Hypocrites, ſpotted, imbrued, and foulely de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filed with all kind of wickedneſs and ſinful life, partly many of them paſſed little upon the Holy
<pb n="367" facs="tcp:54673:190"/> Temple, and cared not whether they came thither or no. And have not the Chriſtians of late days, and even in our days alſo, in like manner provoked the diſpleaſure and indignation of Almighty God? partly becauſe they have profaned and defiled their Churches with Heatheniſh and Jewiſh abuſes, with Images and Idols, with numbers of Altars, too too ſuperſtitiouſly and intolerably abuſed, with groſs abuſing and filthy corrupting of the Lords Holy Supper, the bleſſed Sacrament of his Body and Blood, with an infinite number of toys and trifles of their own devices, to make a goodly outward ſhew, and to deface the plain, ſimple, and ſincere Religion of Chriſt Jeſus; partly, they reſort to the Church like Hypocrites, full of all iniquity and ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful life, having a vain and dangerous fanſie and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſion, that if they come to the Church, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſprinkle them with Holy Water, hear a Maſs, and be bleſſed with the Chalice, though they underſtand not one word of the whole Service, nor feel one motion of Repentance in their Hearts, all is well, all is ſure. Fie upon ſuch mocking and blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming of Gods Holy Ordinance. Churches were made for another purpoſe, that is, to reſort thither, and to ſerve God truly, there to learn his bleſſed Will, there to call upon his mighty Name, there to uſe the Holy Sacraments, there to travel how to be in Charity with thy Neighbour, there to have thy poor and needy Neighbour in remembrance; from thence to depart better and more godly than thou cameſt thither. Finally, Gods vengeance hath been, and is daily provoked, becauſe much wicked People paſs nothing to reſort to the Church, either for that they are ſo ſore blinded, that they under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand nothing of God and godlineſs, and care not with deviliſh example to offend their Neighbours, or elſe for that they ſee the Church altogether ſcoured of ſuch gay gazing ſights, as their groſs phantaſie was greatly delighted with, becauſe they ſee the falſe Religion abandoned, and the true re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtored,
<pb n="368" facs="tcp:54673:191"/> which ſeemeth an unſavoury thing to their unſavoury taſte; as may appear by this that a Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man ſaid to her Neighbour: <hi>Alas, Goſſip, what ſhall we do at Church, ſince all the Saints are taken away, ſince all the goodly Sights we were wont to have, are gone; ſince we cannot hear the like piping, ſinging, chaunting, and playing upon the Organs, that we could before.</hi> But (Dearly Beloved) we ought greatly to rejoyce and give God thanks, that our Churches are delivered out of all thoſe things which diſpleaſed God ſo ſore, and filthily defiled his Holy Houſe and his Place of Prayer, for the which he hath juſtly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed many Nations, according to the ſaying of St. <hi>Paul,</hi>

                        <hi>If any man defile the Temple of God, God will him deſtroy.</hi> And this ought we greatly to praiſe God for, that ſuch Superſtitious and Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trous manners as were utterly naught, and defaced Gods glory, are utterly aboliſhed, as they moſt juſtly deſerved: and yet thoſe things that either God was honoured with, or his People edified, are decently retained, and in our Churches comely practiſed.

But ſee that ye come thither with your Holy-day Garment, not like Hypocrites, not of a cuſtom and for manners ſake, not with lothſomneſs, as though ye had rather not come than come, if ye were at your liberty. For God hateth and puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth ſuch counterfeit Hypocrites, as appeareth by Chriſts former Parable. <hi>My Friend</hi> (ſaith God) <hi>how camest thou in without a Wedding-garment? And therefore commanded his ſervants to bind him hand and foot, and to caſt him into utter darkneſs, where ſhall be weeping, and wailing, and gnaſhing of teeth.</hi> To the intent that ye may avoid the like danger at Gods hand, come to the Church on the Holy-day, and come in your Holy-day Garment; that is to ſay, come with a chearful and a godly Mind, come to ſeek Gods glory, and to be thankful unto him, come to be at one with thy Neighbour, and to enter in Friendſhip and Charity with him. Conſider that all thy doings ſtink before the face of God, if thou be not in Charity with thy Neighbour.

And of this ſimilitude they do for the moſt part receive the ſelf-ſame things they ſignifie.</hi> By theſe words of St. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> it appeareth, that he alloweth the common deſcription of a Sacrament, which is, that it is a viſible ſign of an inviſible Grace: that is to ſay, that ſetteth out to the Eyes and other outward Senſes, the inward working of Gods free Mercy, and doth (as it were) ſeal in our hearts the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes of God. And ſo was Circumciſion a Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which preached unto the outward ſenſes, the inward cutting away of the fore-skin of the Heart, and ſealed and made ſure in the hearts of the Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſed to promiſe of God touching the promiſed Seed that they looked for. Now let us ſee how many ſorts of Prayer, and how many Sacraments there be. In the Scriptures we read of three ſorts of Prayer, whereof two are private, and the third is common. The firſt is that which St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth of in his Epiſtle to <hi>Timothy,</hi> ſaying,<note place="margin">1 Tim. 1.</note> 
                     <hi>I will that men pray in every place, lifting up pure hands, without wrath or ſtriving.</hi> And it is the devout lifting up of the mind to God, without the uttering of the hearts grief or deſire by open voice. Of this Prayer we have example in the firſt Book of the <hi>Kings,</hi> in <hi>Anna,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">1 Kings 1.</note> the Mother of <hi>Samuel,</hi> when in the heavineſs of her Heart ſhe prayed in the Temple, deſiring to be made fruitful. <hi>She prayed in her heart</hi> (ſaith the Text) <hi>but there was no voice heard.</hi> After this ſort muſt all Chriſtians pray, not once in a week, or once in a day only;<note place="margin">1 Theſſ. 3.</note> but as St. <hi>Paul</hi> writeth to the
<pb n="372" facs="tcp:54673:193"/> 
                     <hi>Theſſalonians, without ceaſing.</hi> And as St. <hi>James</hi> writeth,<note place="margin">James 5.</note> 
                     <hi>The continual Prayer of a juſt man is of much force.</hi> The ſecond ſort of Prayer is ſpoken of in the Goſpel of <hi>Matthew,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Matt. 6.</note> where it is ſaid, <hi>When thou prayeſt, enter into thy ſecret Cloſet, and when thou haſt ſhut the door to thee, pray unto thy Father in ſecret, and thy Father which ſeeth in ſecret ſhall reward thee.</hi> Of this ſort of Prayer there be ſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry examples in the Scriptures, but it ſhall ſuffice to rehearſe one, which is written in the <hi>Acts of the Apoſtles.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">Acts 10.</note>
                     <hi>Cornelius,</hi> a devout man, a Captain of the <hi>Italian</hi> Army, ſaith to <hi>Peter,</hi> that being in his Houſe in Prayer at the ninth hour, there appeared to him one in a white Garment, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> This man prayed unto God in ſecret, and was rewarded openly. Theſe be the two private ſorts of Prayer. The one men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal, that is to ſay, the devout lifting up of the mind to God: And the other vocal, that is to ſay, the ſecret uttering of the griefs and deſires of the Heart with words, but yet in a ſecret Cloſet, or ſome ſolitary place. The third ſort of Prayer is publick or common. Of this Prayer ſpeaketh our Saviour Chriſt,<note place="margin">Mat. 18.</note> when he ſaith, <hi>If two of you ſhall agree upon Earth upon any thing, whatſoever ye ſhall ask, my Father which is in Heaven ſhall do it for you, for whereſoever two or three be gathered toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in my name, there am I in the midſt of them.</hi> Although God hath promiſed to hear us when we pray privately, ſo it be done faithfully and devoutly (for he ſaith,<note place="margin">Pſal. 50.</note> 
                     <hi>Call upon me in the day of thy trouble, and I will hear thee. And</hi> Elias <hi>being but a mortal man,</hi>

                        </gap>d, and the Heaven gave rain:</hi>) Yet by the Hiſtories of the Bible it appeareth, that publick and common Prayer is moſt available before God, and therefore is much to be lamented that it is no better eſteemed among us which profeſs to be but one body in Chriſt. When the City of <hi>Niniveh</hi> was threatned to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed<note place="margin">Jonas 3.</note>
                     <pb n="373" facs="tcp:54673:193"/> within forty days, the Prince and the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple joyned themſelves together in publick Prayer and Faſting, and were preſerved. In the Prophet <hi>Joel,</hi> God commanded a Faſting to be proclaimed,<note place="margin">Joel 2.</note> and the People to be gathered together, young and old, man and woman, and are taught to ſay with one voice, <hi>Spare us, O Lord, ſpare thy People, and let not thine Inheritance be brought to confuſion.</hi> When the Jews ſhould have been deſtroyed all in one day, through the malice of <hi>Haman,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Heſter 4.</note> at the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment of <hi>Heſter,</hi> they Faſted and Prayed, and were preſerved.<note place="margin">Judith 8.</note> When <hi>Holophernes</hi> beſieged <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thulia,</hi> by the advice of <hi>Judith</hi> they Faſted and Prayed, and were delivered.<note place="margin">Acts 12.</note> When <hi>Peter</hi> was in Priſon, the Congregation joyned themſelves toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in Prayer, and <hi>Peter</hi> was wonderfully delivered. By theſe Hiſtories it appeareth, that common or publick Prayer is of great force to obtain mercy and deliverance at our Heavenly Fathers hand.</p>
                  <p>Therefore, Brethren, I beſeech you, even for the tender mercies of God, let us no longer be neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent in this behalf: but as the People willing to receive at Gods hand ſuch good things as in the Common-Prayer of the Church are craved, let us joyn our ſelves together in the Place of Common-Prayer, and with one voice, and one heart, beg at our Heavenly Father all thoſe things which he know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to be neceſſary for us. I forbid you not private Prayer, but I exhort you to eſteem Common-Prayer as it is worthy. And before all things, be ſure that in all theſe three ſorts of Prayer, your minds be devoutly lifted up to God, elſe are your Prayers to no purpoſe; and this ſaying ſhall be verified in you, <hi>This people honoureth me with their lips,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Eſay 29. Matt. 15.</note> 
                     <hi>but their heart is far from me.</hi> Thus much for the three ſorts of Prayer, whereof we read in the Scriptures. Now with like, or rather more brevity, you ſhall hear how many Sacraments there be, that were inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by our Saviour Chriſt, and are to be continued, and received of every Chriſtian in due time and
<pb n="374" facs="tcp:54673:194"/> order, and for ſuch purpoſe as our Saviour Chriſt willed them to be received. And as for the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of them, if they ſhould be conſidered accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the exact ſignification of a Sacrament, namely, for the viſible ſigns, expreſly commanded in the New Teſtament, whereunto is annexed the promiſe of free forgiveneſs of our ſins, and of our holineſs and joyning in Chriſt, there be but two; namely, Baptiſm, and the Supper of the Lord. For al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though Abſolution hath the promiſe of forgiveneſs of ſin, yet by the expreſs word of the New Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament, it hath not this promiſe annexed and tied to the viſible ſign, which is impoſition of hands. For this viſible ſign (I mean laying on of hands) is not expreſly commanded in the New Teſtament to be uſed in Abſolution, as the viſible ſigns in Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm and the Lords Supper are: and therefore Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution is no ſuch Sacrament as Baptiſm and the Communion are. And though the ordering of Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters hath this viſible ſign and promiſe, yet it lacks the promiſe of remiſſion of ſin, as all other Sacraments beſides the two above-named do. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore neither it, nor any other Sacrament elſe, be ſuch Sacraments as Baptiſm and the Communion are. But in a general acception, the name of a Sacrament may be attributed to any thing whereby an holy thing is ſignified. In which underſtanding of the Word, the ancient Writers have given this name, not only to the other five, commonly of late years taken and uſed for ſupplying the number of the ſeven Sacraments: but alſo to divers and ſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry other Ceremonies, as to Oyl, waſhing of Feet, and ſuch like; not meaning thereby to repute them as Sacraments, in the ſame ſignification that the two fore-named Sacraments are And therefore St. <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtine</hi> weighing the true ſignification,<note place="margin">Dionyſius, Bernard. de caena Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni, &amp; ablut. pedum.</note> and the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>act meaning of the word, writing to <hi>Januarius,</hi> and alſo in the third Book of Chriſtian Doctrine, affirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, that the Sacraments of the Chriſtians, as they are moſt excellent in ſignification, ſo are they moſt
<pb n="375" facs="tcp:54673:194"/> few in number; and in both places maketh mention expreſly of two, the Sacrament of Baptiſm, and the Supper of the Lord. And although there are retained by the Order of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> beſides theſe two, certain other Rites and Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies about the inſtitutions of Miniſters in the Church, Matrimony, Confirmation of the Children, by examining them of their knowledge in the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles of the Faith, and joyning thereto the Prayers of the Church for them, and likewiſe for the Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitation of the Sick: yet no man ought to take theſe for Sacraments, in ſuch ſignification and mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as the Sacraments of Baptiſm and the Lords Supper are: but either for godly ſtates of life, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary in Chriſts Church, and therefore worthy to be ſet forth by publick action and ſolemnity, by the Miniſtry of the Church, or elſe judged to be ſuch Ordinances, as may make for the Inſtruction, Comfort, and Edification of Chriſts Church.</p>
                  <p>Now, underſtanding ſufficiently what Prayer is, and what a Sacrament is alſo; and how many ſorts of Prayers there be, and how many Sacraments of our Saviour Chriſts inſtitution: let us ſee whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Scriptures and examples of the Primitive Church will allow any vocal Prayer, that is, when the mouth uttereth the Petitions with voice, or any manner of Sacrament, or other publick or common Rite or Action, pertaining to the profit and edify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the unlearned, to be miniſtred in a Tongue unknown, or not underſtood of the Miniſter or People: yea, and whether any Perſon may privately uſe any Vocal Prayer, in a Language that he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf underſtandeth not. To this queſtion we muſt anſwer, No. And firſt of Common-Prayer and Adminiſtration of Sacraments. Although Reaſon, if it might Rule, would ſoon perſwade us to have our Common-Prayer and Adminiſtration of the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments in a known Tongue, both for that to pray commonly, is for a multitude to ask one and the ſelf-ſame thing with one voice, and one conſent of
<pb n="376" facs="tcp:54673:195"/> mind; and to adminiſter a Sacrament, is by the outward Word and Element, to preach to the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiver the inward and inviſible grace of God, and alſo for that both theſe Exerciſes were firſt inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and are ſtill continued, to the end, that the Congregation of Chriſt might from time to time be put in remembrance of their Unity in Chriſt, and that as Members all of one Body, they ought both in Prayers and otherwiſe, to ſeek and deſire one anothers commodity, and not their own without others: Yet ſhall we not need to flee to Reaſons and Proofs in this matter, ſith we have both the plain and manifeſt words of the Scripture; and alſo the conſent of the moſt learned and ancient Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, to commend the Prayers of the Congregation in a known Tongue. Firſt, <hi>Paul</hi> to the <hi>Corinthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> ſaith,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 14.</note> 
                     <hi>Let all things be done to edifying.</hi> Which cannot be, unleſs Common Prayers and Admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration of Sacraments be in a Tongue known to the People. For where the Prayers ſpoken by the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter, and the words in the Adminiſtration of the Sacraments be not underſtood of them that be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, they cannot thereby be edified. For, as when the Trumpet that is blown in the Field giveth an uncertain ſound, no man is thereby ſtirred up to prepare himſelf to the Fight. And as when an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument of Muſick maketh no diſtinct ſound, no man can tell what is piped: Even ſo when Prayers, or Adminiſtration of Sacraments ſhall be in a Tongue unknown to the hearers, which of them ſhall be thereby ſtirred up to lift up his mind to God, and to beg with the Miniſter at Gods hand, thoſe things which in the words of his Prayers the Miniſter asketh? Or who ſhall in the miniſtration of the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments underſtand what inviſible grace is to be craved of the Hearer, to be wrought in the inward man? Truly no man at all. For (ſaith St. <hi>Paul) He that ſpeaketh in a Tongue unknown, ſhall be to the Hearer an Aliant,</hi> which in a Chriſtian Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is a great abſurdity.</p>

                     <hi>but we are the Citizens of the Saints, and of the houſhold of God, yea, and members of one body.</hi> And therefore whiles our Miniſter is in rehearſing the Prayer that is made in the name of us all, we muſt give dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent ears to the words ſpoken by him, and in heart beg at Gods hand thoſe things that he beggeth in words. And to ſignifie that we do ſo, we ſay, <hi>Amen,</hi> at the end of the Prayer that he maketh in the name of us all. And this thing can we not do for edification, unleſs we underſtand what is ſpoken. Therefore it is required of neceſſity, that the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-Prayer be had in a Tongue that the Hearers do underſtand. If ever it had been tolerable to uſe ſtrange Tongues in the Congregations, the ſame might have been in the time of <hi>Paul</hi> and the other Apoſtles, when they were miraculouſly endued with gifts of Tongues. For it might then have perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded ſome to embrace the Goſpel, when they had heard men that were <hi>Hebrews</hi> born and unlearned, ſpeak the <hi>Greek,</hi> the <hi>Latine,</hi> and other Languages. But <hi>Paul</hi> thought it not tolerable then: And ſhall we uſe it now, when no man cometh by that know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of Tongues, otherwiſe than by diligent and earneſt ſtudy? God forbid. For we ſhould by that means bring all our Church-exerciſes to frivolous Superſtition, and make them altogether unfruitful. <hi>Luke</hi> writeth,<note place="margin">Acts 4.</note> that when <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>John</hi> were diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged by the Princes and High-Prieſts of <hi>Jeruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem,</hi> they came to their fellows, and told them all that the Princes of the Prieſts and Elders had ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken to them. <hi>Which when they heard, they lifted up their voice together to God with one aſſent, and ſaid, Lord, thou art he that haſt made Heaven and Earth, the Sea, and all things that are in them, &amp;c.</hi> Thus could they not have done, if they had prayed in a ſtrange Tongue, that they had not underſtood. And no doubt of it, they did not all ſpeak with ſeveral voices, but ſome one of them ſpake in the name of them all, and the reſt giving diligent ear
<pb n="378" facs="tcp:54673:196"/> to his words, conſented thereunto; and therefore it is ſaid, <hi>that they lifted up their voice together.</hi> St. <hi>Luke</hi> ſaith not, Their voices, as many; but their voice, as one. That one voice therefore was in ſuch Language as they all underſtood, otherwiſe they could not have lifted it up with the conſent of their hearts. For no man can give conſent of the thing that he knoweth not. As touching the Times before the coming of Chriſt, there was never man yet that would affirm, that either the People of God, or other had their Prayers or Adminiſtrations of the Sacraments, or Sacrifices, in a Tongue that they themſelves underſtood not. As for the time ſince Chriſt, till that uſurped Power of <hi>Rome</hi> began to ſpread it ſelf, and to inforce all the Nations of <hi>Europe</hi> to have the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Language in admiration, it appeareth by the conſent of the moſt Ancient and Learned Writers, that there was no ſtrange or unknown Tongue uſed in the Congregation of Chriſtians.</p>

<pb n="382" facs="tcp:54673:198"/> is made unto ſalvation. <hi>Therefore for theſe cauſes it is convenient that among other Prayers, thoſe things alſo which are ſpoken in the Holy Oblation, be uttered, and ſpoken of the moſt Religious Biſhops and Prieſts, unto our Lord Jeſus Chriſt our God, with the Father and the Holy Ghoſt, with a loud voice. And let the moſt Religious Prieſts know this, that if they neglect any of theſe things, that they ſhall give an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count for them in the dreadful judgment of the great God and our Saviour Jeſus Christ. Neither will we, when we know it, rest and leave it unrevenged.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This Emperor (as <hi>Sabellicus</hi> writeth) favoured the Biſhop of <hi>Rome,</hi> and yet we ſee how plain a Decree he maketh, for Praying and Adminiſtring of Sacraments in a known Tongue, that the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion of the Hearers might be ſtirred up by know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, contrary to the judgment of them that would have Ignorance to make Devotion. He ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth it alſo a matter of Damnation, to do theſe things in a Tongue that the Hearers underſtand not. Let us therefore conclude with God and all good mens aſſent, that no Common-Prayer or Sacraments ought to be miniſtred in a Tongue that is not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood of the Hearers. Now, a word or two of private Prayer in an unknown Tongue. We took in hand where we began to ſpeak of this matter, not only to prove that no Common-Prayer, or Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtration of Sacraments, ought to be in a Tongue unknown to the Hearers, but alſo that no Perſon ought to Pray privately in that Tongue that he himſelf underſtandeth not. Which thing ſhall not be hard to prove, if we forget not what Prayer is. For if Prayer be that Devotion of the Mind which enforceth the Heart to lift up it ſelf to God; how ſhould it be ſaid, that that Perſon prayeth, that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtandeth not the words that his Tongue ſpeaketh in Prayer? Yea, how can it be ſaid, that he ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth? For to ſpeak, is by voice to utter the thought of the mind. And the voice that a man uttereth in ſpeaking, is nothing elſe but the Meſſenger of
<pb n="383" facs="tcp:54673:198"/> the mind to bring abroad the knowledge of that which otherwiſe lieth ſecret in the heart, and can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be known, according to that which St. <hi>Paul</hi> writeth;<note place="margin">1 Cor. 2.</note> 
                     <hi>What man</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>knoweth the things that appertain to man, ſaving only the ſpirit of man, which is in man?</hi> He therefore that doth not under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand the voices that his Tongue doth utter, cannot properly be ſaid to ſpeak, but rather to counterfeit, as Parats, and ſuch other Birds uſe to counterfeit mens voices. No man therefore that feareth to provoke the wrath of God againſt himſelf, will be ſo bold to ſpeak of God unadviſedly, without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard, of reverent underſtanding, in his preſence, but he will prepare his Heart before he preſume to ſpeak unto God. And therefore in our Common-Prayer the Miniſter doth often-times ſay, <hi>Let us pray,</hi> meaning thereby to admoniſh the People that they ſhould prepare their Ears to hear what he ſhould crave at Gods hand, and their Hearts to conſent to the ſame, and their Tongues to ſay <hi>Amen</hi> at the end thereof. On this ſort did the Prophet <hi>David</hi> prepare his Heart, when he ſaid,<note place="margin">Pſal. 57.</note>

But foraſmuch as the Perſon that ſo bableth his words without ſenſe in the preſence of God, ſheweth himſelf not to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard the Majeſty of him that he ſpeaketh to: He taketh him as a contemner of his Almighty Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty, and giveth <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Hither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to he ſeemeth to bear with Praying in an unknown Tongue. But in the next ſentence he openeth his mind thus: Not for that theſe things ought not to be amended, that the People may ſay <hi>Amen,</hi> to that which they do plainly underſtand But yet theſe godly things muſt be born withal of theſe Catechiſts, or Inſtructors of the Faith, that they may learn, that as in the Common Place where matters are pleaded, the goodneſs of an Oration conſiſteth in ſound, ſo in the Church it conſiſteth in Devotion. So that he alloweth not the praying in a Tongue not underſtood of him that prayeth: But he inſtructeth the skilful Orator, to bear with the rude Tongue of the devout ſimple Miniſter. To conclude, If the lack of underſtanding the words that are ſpoken in the Congregation, do make them unfruitful to the
<pb n="385" facs="tcp:54673:199"/> Hearers, how ſhould not the ſame make the words read, unfruitful to the Reader? The merciful good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of God, grant us his grace to call upon him as we ought to do, to his glory and our endleſs felicity; which we ſhall do, if we humble our ſelves in his ſight, and in all our Prayers, both common and private, have our minds fully fixed upon him.<note place="margin">Ecclus. 35.</note>

Yea, he ſpeaketh now in the Scriptures more profitably to us, than he did
<pb n="388" facs="tcp:54673:201"/> by word of mouth to the carnal Jews when he lived with them here upon Earth. For they (I mean the Jews) could neither hear nor ſee thoſe things which we may now both hear and ſee, if we will bring with us thoſe Ears and Eyes that Chriſt is heard and ſeen with; that is, diligence to hear and read his Holy Scriptures, and true Faith to believe his moſt comfortable Promiſes. If one could ſhew but the print of Chriſts Foot, a great number I think would fall down and worſhip it: But to the Holy Scriptures, where we may ſee daily (if we will) I will not ſay the print of his Feet only, but the whole ſhape and lively Image of him, alas, we give little reverence, or none at all.</p>
                     <p>If any could let us ſee Chriſts Coat, a ſort of us would make hard ſhift except we might come nigh to gaze upon it, yea, and kiſs it too. And yet all the Clothes that ever he did wear, can nothing ſo truly, nor ſo lively expreſs him unto us, as do the Scriptures. Chriſts Images made in Wood, Stone, or Metal, ſome men for the love they bear to Chriſt, do garniſh and beautifie the ſame with Pearl, Gold, and Precious Stones: And ſhould we not (good Brethren) much rather embrace and reverence Gods Holy Books, the ſacred Bible, which do re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſent Chriſt unto us more truly than can any Image. The Image can but expreſs the form or ſhape of his Body, if it can do ſo much: But the Scriptures do in ſuch ſort ſet forth Chriſt, that we may ſee both God and man; we may ſee him (I ſay) ſpeaking unto us, healing our Infirmities, dying for our ſins, riſing from death for our Juſtification. And to be ſhort, we may in the Scriptures ſo perfectly ſee whole Chriſt with the Eye of Faith, as we, lacking Faith, could not with theſe bodily Eyes ſee him, though he ſtood now preſent here before us. Let every Man, Woman, and Child, therefore with all their Hearts thirſt and deſire Gods Holy Scriptures, love them, embrace them, have their delight and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure in hearing and reading them, ſo as at length we
<pb n="389" facs="tcp:54673:201"/> may be transformed and changed into them. For the Holy Scriptures are Gods Treaſure-Houſe, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in are found all things needful for us to ſee, to hear, to learn, and to believe neceſſary for the attaining of Eternal Life. Thus much is ſpoken, only to give you a taſte of ſome of the Commodities which ye may take by hearing and reading the Holy Scriptures. For as I ſaid in the beginning, no Tongue is able to declare and utter all. And although it is more clear than the noon day, that to be ignorant of the Scriptures, is the cauſe of Error, as Chriſt ſaith to the <hi>Sadduces, Ye err, not knowing the Scriptures;</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Mat. 22.</note> and that Error doth hold back, and pluck men away from the knowledge of God. And as St. <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rome</hi> ſaith, Not to know the Scriptures, is to be ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant of Chriſt. Yet this notwithſtanding, ſome there be that think it not meet for all ſorts of men to read the Scriptures, becauſe they are, as they think, in ſundry places ſtumbling-blocks to the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>learned. Firſt, for that the phraſe of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is ſometime ſo ſimple, groſs, and plain, that it offendeth the fine and delicate Wits of ſome Courtiers. Furthermore, for that the Scripture alſo reporteth, even of them that have their commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation to be the Children of God, that they did di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers acts, whereof ſome are contrary to the Law of Nature, ſome repugnant to the Law written, and other ſome ſeem to fight manifeſtly againſt publick Honeſty. All which things (ſay they) are unto the ſimple an occaſion of great offence, and cauſe many to think evil of the Scriptures, and to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credit their Authority. Some are offended at the hearing and reading of the diverſity of the Rites and Ceremonies of the Sacrifices and Oblations of the Law. And ſome worldly witted men think it great decay to the quiet and prudent governing of their Common-weals, to give ear to the ſimple and plain Rules and Precepts of our Saviour Chriſt in his Goſpel, as being offended that a man ſhould be ready to turn his right Ear to him that ſtruck him
<pb n="390" facs="tcp:54673:202"/> on the left; and to him which would take away his Coat, to offer him alſo his Cloak; with ſuch other ſayings of perfection in Chriſts meaning. For Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Reaſon, being alway an Enemy to God, and not perceiving the things of Gods Spirit, doth abhor ſuch Precepts, which yet rightly underſtood, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fringeth no Judicial Policies, nor Chriſtian mens Governments. And ſome there be, which hearing the Scriptures to bid us to live without carefulneſs, without ſtudy or fore-caſting, to deride the ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicities of them. Therefore to remove and put away occaſions of offence ſo much as may be, I will anſwer orderly to theſe Objections. Firſt, I ſhall rehearſe ſome of thoſe places that men are offended at, for the ſimplicity and groſneſs of ſpeech, and will ſhew the meaning of them. In the Book of <hi>Deuteronomy</hi> it is written, <hi>That Almighty God made a Law, if a man died without iſſue, his brother or next kinſman ſhould marry his Widow, and the child that was firſt born between them, ſhould be called his child that was dead, that the dead mans name might not be put out in</hi> Iſrael: <hi>And if the Brother or next Kinſman would not marry the Widow, then ſhe before the Magiſtrates of the City ſhould pull off his ſhoe, and ſpit in his face, ſaying, So be it done to that man that will not build his brothers houſe.</hi> Here (Dearly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved) the pulling off his ſhoe, and ſpitting in his face, were Ceremonies, to ſignifie unto all the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of that City, that the Woman was not now in fault that Gods Law in that point was broken, but the whole ſhame and blame thereof, did now re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dound to that man, which openly before the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates refuſed to marry her. And it was not a reproach to him alone, but to all his Poſterity alſo: For they were called ever after, <hi>The Houſe of him whoſe ſhoe is pulled off.</hi> Another place out of the <hi>Pſalms:</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Pſal. 75.</note> 
                        <hi>I will break</hi> (ſaith <hi>David) the horns of the ungodly, and the horns of the righteous ſhall be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alted.</hi> By an Horn, in the Scripture, is underſtood Power, Might, Strength, and ſometime Rule and
<pb n="391" facs="tcp:54673:202"/> Government. The Prophet then ſaying, <hi>I will break the horns of the ungodly,</hi> meaneth, that all the Power, Strength, and Might of Gods Enemies, ſhall not only be weakned and made feeble, but ſhall at length alſo be clean broken and deſtroyed, though for a time, for the better tryal of his People, God ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fereth the Enemies to prevail and have the upper hand. In the 132 <hi>Pſalm,</hi> it is ſaid,<note place="margin">Pſal. 132.</note> 
                        <hi>I will make</hi> David<hi>'s horn to flouriſh.</hi> Here <hi>David</hi>'s Horn ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fieth his Kingdom. Almighty God therefore by this manner of ſpeaking, promiſeth to give <hi>David</hi> Victory over all his Enemies, and to ſtabliſh him in his Kingdom, ſpite of all his Enemies. And in the threeſcore <hi>Pſalm</hi> it is written, Moab <hi>is my waſh-pot,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Pſal. 60.</note> 
                        <hi>and over</hi> Edom <hi>will I caſt out my ſhoe,</hi> &amp;c. In that place the Prophet ſheweth how graciouſly God hath dealt with his People the Children of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> giving them great Victories upon their Enemies on every ſide. For the <hi>Moabites</hi> and <hi>Idumeans</hi> being two great Nations, proud People, ſtout and mighty, God brought them under, and made them Servants to the <hi>Iſraelites;</hi> Servants, I ſay, to ſtoop down, to pull off their ſhoes, and waſh their feet. <hi>Then</hi> Moab <hi>is my waſh-pot, and over</hi> Edom <hi>will I caſt out my ſhoe,</hi> is, as if he had ſaid, The <hi>Moabites</hi> and the <hi>Idumeans,</hi> for all their ſtoutneſs againſt us in the Wilderneſs, are now made our Subjects, ou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap> Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, yea, Underlings to pull off our ſhoes, and waſh our feet. Now I pray you, what uncomely manner of ſpeech is this, ſo uſed in common phraſe among the <hi>Hebrews?</hi> It is a ſhame that Chriſtian men ſhould be ſo light headed, to toy as Ruffians do with ſuch manner of ſpeeches, uttered in good grave ſignification by the Holy Ghoſt. More rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable it were for vain men to learn to reverence the form of Gods Words, than to ſport at them to their Damnation. Some again are offended to hear that the godly Fathers had many Wives and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cubines, although after the phraſe of the Scripture, a Concubine is an honeſt name; for every Concu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bine
<pb n="392" facs="tcp:54673:203"/> is a Lawful Wife, but every Wife is not a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cubine. And that ye may the better underſtand this to be true, ye ſhall note that it was permitted to the Fathers of the Old Teſtament to have at one time moe Wives than one, for what purpoſe ye ſhall afterward hear. Of which Wives ſome were Free-women born, ſome were Bond-women and Servants. She that was Free-born had a Prerogative above thoſe that were Servants and Bond-women. The Free-born Woman was by Marriage made the Ruler of the Houſe under her Husband, and is called the Mother of the Houſhold, the Miſtreſs or the Dame of the Houſe, after our manner of ſpeaking, and had by her Marriage an Intereſt, a Right, and an Ownerſhip of his Goods unto whom ſhe was mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried. Other Servants and Bond-women were given by the Owners of them, as the manner was then, I will not ſay always, but for the moſt part, unto their Daughters at the day of their Marriage, to be Handmaidens unto them. After ſuch a ſort did <hi>Pharaoh</hi> King of <hi>Egypt</hi> give unto <hi>Sarah,</hi>

                        <hi>Lea</hi> gave in like manner her Maid <hi>Zilpha</hi> to her Husband <hi>Jacob.</hi> So did <hi>Rachel</hi> his other Wife give him <hi>Bilha</hi> her Maid,<note place="margin">Gen. 30.</note> ſaying unto him, <hi>Go in unto her, and ſhe ſhall bear upon my knees:</hi> which is, as if ſhe had ſaid, Take her to Wife, and the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren that ſhe ſhall bear, will I take upon my lap, and make of them as if they were mine own. Theſe Hand-maidens or Bond-women, although by Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage they were made Wives, yet they had not this Prerogative to Rule in the Houſe, but were ſtill Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derlings, and in ſuch ſubjection to their Maſters,
<pb n="393" facs="tcp:54673:203"/> and were never called Mothers of the Houſhould, Miſtreſſes, or Dames of the Houſe, but are called ſometimes Wives, ſometimes Concubines. The plurality of Wives was by a ſpecial Prerogative ſuffered to the Fathers of the Old Teſtament, not for ſatisfying their carnal and fleſhly Luſts, but to have many Children, becauſe every one of them hoped, and begged oft-times of God in their Prayers, that that Bleſſed Seed, which God pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed ſhould come into the World to break the Serpents Head, might come and be born of this ſtock and kindred.</p>
                     <p>Now of thoſe which take occaſion of carnality and evil life, by hearing and reading in Gods Book, what God had ſuffered, even in thoſe men whoſe commendation is praiſed in the Scripture: As that <hi>Noe,</hi>

Theſe and ſuch like in Gods Book (good People) are not written that we ſhould or may do the like following their examples, or that we ought to think that God did allow every of theſe things in thoſe men: But we ought rather to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve and to judge that <hi>Noe</hi> in his drunkenneſs of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended God highly. <hi>Lot</hi> lying with his Daughters, committed horrible Inceſt. We ought then to learn by them this profitable Leſſon, that if ſo godly men
<pb n="394" facs="tcp:54673:204"/> as they were, which otherwiſe felt inwardly Gods Holy Spirit inflaming their hearts with the fear and love of God, could not by their own ſtrength keep themſelves from committing horrible ſin, but did ſo grievouſly fall, that without Gods great Mercy they had periſhed everlaſtingly: How much more ought we then, miſerable wretches, which have no feeling of God within us at all, continually to fear, not only that we may fall as they did, but alſo be overcome and drowned in ſin, which they were not? And ſo by conſidering their fall, take the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter occaſion to acknowledge our own Infirmity and weakneſs, and therefore more earneſtly to call unto Almighty God with hearty Prayer inceſſantly, for his grace to ſtrengthen us, and to defend us from all evil. And though through Infirmity we chance at any time to fall, yet we may by hearty Repentance, and true Faith ſpeedily riſe again, and not ſleep and continue in ſin, as the wicked doth.</p>
                     <p>Thus, good People, ſhould we underſtand ſuch matters expreſſed in the Divine Scriptures, that this Holy Table of Gods Word be not turned to us to be a ſnare, a trap, and a ſtumbling ſtone, to take hurt by the abuſe of our Underſtanding: But let us eſteem them in a reverent Humility, that we may find our neceſſary Food therein, to ſtrengthen us, to comfort us, to inſtruct us (as God of his great Mercy hath appointed them) in all neceſſary works, ſo that we may be perfect before him in the whole courſe of our life: Which he grant, who hath Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemed us, our Lord and Saviour Jeſus Chriſt; to whom with the Father, and the Holy Ghoſt, be all Honour and Glory for evermore. <hi>Amen.</hi>

The Prophet then calleth them ſinners, whoſe hearts are clean turned from God, and whoſe whole converſation of life is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but ſin, they delight ſo much in the ſame, that they chooſe continually to abide and dwell in ſin. The third ſort he calleth ſcorners; that is, a ſort of men whoſe hearts are ſo ſtuffed with Malice, that they are not contented to dwell in ſin, and to lead their lives in all kind of wickedneſs: but alſo they do contemn and ſcorn in other all Godlineſs, true Religion, all Honeſty and Vertue. Of the two firſt ſorts of men, I will not ſay but they may take Repentance, and be converted unto God. Of the third ſort, I think I may without danger of Gods judgment, pronounce, that never any yet converted unto God by Repentance, but continued ſtill in their abominable wickedneſs, heaping up to themſelves damnation, againſt the day of Gods inevitable Judgment. Examples of ſuch ſcorners, we read in the Second Book of <hi>Chronicles:</hi>
                        <note place="margin">2 Par. 30.</note> When the good King <hi>Ezechias</hi> in the beginning of his Reign, had deſtroyed Idolatry, purged the Temple, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed Religion in his Realm, he ſent Meſſengers
<pb n="398" facs="tcp:54673:206"/> into every City, to gather the People unto <hi>Jeruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem,</hi> to ſolemnize the Feaſt of <hi>Eaſter,</hi> in ſuch ſort as God had appointed. The Poſts went from City to City, through the Land of <hi>Ephraim</hi> and <hi>Manaſſes,</hi> even unto <hi>Zabulon.</hi> And what did the People, think ye? Did they land and praiſe the Name of the Lord which had given them ſo good a King, ſo zealous a Prince to aboliſh Idolatry, and to reſtore again Gods true Religion? No, no. The Scripture ſaith, <hi>The people laughed them to ſcorn, and mocked the Kings Meſſengers.</hi> And in the laſt Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of the ſame Book it is written, <hi>That Almighty God, having compaſſion upon his people, ſent his Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſengers the Prophets unto them, to call them from their abominable Idolatry and wicked kind of living. But they mocked his Meſſengers, they deſpiſed his words, and miſuſed his Prophets, until the wrath of the Lord aroſe againſt his people, and till there was no remedy: For he gave them up into the hands of their enemies, even unto</hi> Nabuchodonoſor <hi>King of</hi> Babylon, <hi>who ſpoiled them of their Goods, burnt their City, and led them, their Wives, and their Children, Captives unto</hi> Babylon. The wicked People that were in the days of <hi>Noe,</hi> made but a mock at the Word of God, when <hi>Noe</hi> told them, that God would take venge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance upon them for their ſins. The Flood there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore came ſuddenly upon them, and drowned them, with the whole World. <hi>Lot</hi> Preached to the <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domites,</hi> that except they repented, both they and their City ſhould be deſtroyed. They thought his ſayings impoſſible to be true, they ſcorned and mock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his Admonition, and reputed him as an old do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting Fool. But when God by his Holy Angels had taken <hi>Lot,</hi> his Wife, and two Daughters from a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them, he rained down Fire and Brimſtone from Heaven, and burnt up thoſe ſcorners and mockers of his Holy Word. And what eſtimation had Chriſts Doctrine among the <hi>Scribes</hi> and <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſees?</hi> What Reward had he among them? The Goſpel reporteth thus: The <hi>Phariſees,</hi> which were
<pb n="399" facs="tcp:54673:206"/> covetous, did ſcorn him in his Doctrine. O then ye ſee that worldly rich men ſcorn the Doctrine of their Salvation. The worldly wiſe men ſcorn the Doctrine of Chriſt, as fooliſhneſs to their Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding. Theſe ſcorners have ever been, and ever ſhall be to the Worlds end.<note place="margin">2 Pet. 3.</note> For St. <hi>Peter</hi> Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſied, <hi>that ſuch ſcorners ſhould be in the world before the latter day.</hi> Take heed therefore (my Brethren) take heed, be ye not ſcorners of Gods moſt Holy Word, provoke him not to pour out his wrath now upon you, as he did then upon thoſe Gybers and Mockers. Be not wilful murderers of your own Souls. Turn unto God while there is yet time of Mercy, ye ſhall elſe repent it in the World to come, when it ſhall be too late, for there ſhall be Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment without Mercy. This might ſuffice to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniſh us, and cauſe us henceforth to reverence Gods Holy Scriptures, but all men have not Faith. This therefore ſhall not ſatisfie and content all mens minds: but as ſome are carnal, ſo they will ſtill con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue, and abuſe the Scriptures carnally, to their greater damnation.<note place="margin">2 Pet. 3.</note>

Let us earneſtly take heed that we make no jeſting-ſtock of the Books of Holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures. The more obſcure and dark the ſayings be to our Underſtanding, the further let us think our ſelves to be from God, and his Holy Spirit, who was the Author of them. Let us with more reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence endeavour our ſelves to ſearch out the wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom hidden in the outward Bark of the Scripture. If we cannot underſtand the ſenſe and the reaſon of the ſaying, yet let us not be ſcorners, jeſters, and deriders, for that is the uttermoſt token and ſhew of a Reprobate, of a plain Enemy to God and his wiſdom. They be not idle Fables to jeſt at, which God doth ſeriouſly pronounce, and for ſerious mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters let us eſteem them. And though in ſundry places of the Scriptures be ſet out divers Rites and Ceremonies, Oblations and Sacrifices; let us not think ſtrange of them, but refer them to the Times and People for whom they ſerved, although yet to learned men they be not unprofitable to be conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered, but to be expounded as figures and ſhadows of things and perſons, afterward openly revealed in the New Teſtament. Though the rehearſal of the Genealogies and Pedegrees of the Fathers be not to much edification of the plain ignorant peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; yet is there nothing ſo impertinently uttered in all the whole Book of the Bible, but may ſerve to ſpiritual purpoſe in ſome reſpect, to all ſuch as will beſtow their labours to ſearch out the meanings.

                     <p>And whereas we read in divers <hi>Pſalms,</hi> how <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> did wiſh to the Adverſaries of God ſometimes ſhame, rebuke, and confuſion; ſometime the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cay of their Off-ſpring and Iſſue, ſometime that they might periſh and come ſuddenly to deſtruction; as he did wiſh to the Captains of the <hi>Philiſtines. Caſt forth</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>thy lightning, and tear them; ſhoot out thine arrows and conſume them:</hi> with ſuch other manner of Imprecations. Yet ought we not to be offended at ſuch Prayers of <hi>David,</hi> being a Prophet as he was, ſingularly beloved of God, and wrapt in ſpirit, with an ardent zeal to Gods glory. He ſpake not of a private hatred, and in a ſtomach againſt their Perſons: but wiſhed ſpiritually the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of ſuch corrupt Errors and Vices, which reigned in all deviliſh Perſons, ſet againſt God.

And yet this notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding (ſuch is the ſlothful ſluggiſhneſs of our dull Nature, to that which is good and godly) that we are almoſt in nothing more negligent and leſs careful than we are therein.

By the which both the godly charitable Perſons may be encouraged to go forwards and continue in their merciful Deeds of Alms-giving to the Poor, and alſo ſuch as hitherto have either neglected, or contemned it, may yet now at length (when they ſhall hear how much it appertaineth to them) adviſedly conſider it, and vertuouſly apply themſelves thereunto.</p>
                     <p>And to the intent that every one of you may the better underſtand that which is taught, and alſo eaſilier bear away, and ſo take more fruit of that ſhall be ſaid, when ſeveral matters are ſeverally handled: I mind particularly, and in this order, to ſpeak and intreat of theſe points.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, I will ſhew how earneſtly Almighty God in his Holy Word, doth exact the doing of Alms-Deeds of us, and how acceptable they be unto him.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, how profitable it is for us to uſe them, and what commodity and fruit they will bring unto us.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly and laſtly, I will ſhew out of Gods Word, that whoſo is liberal to the Poor, and relieveth them plenteouſly, ſhall notwithſtanding have ſufficient for himſelf, and evermore be without danger of penury and ſcarcity.</p>
                     <p>Concerning the firſt, which is the acceptation and dignity, or price of Alms-Deeds before God: Know this, that to help and ſuccour the Poor in their need and miſery, pleaſeth God ſo much, that as the Holy Scripture in ſundry places recordeth, nothing can be more thankfully taken or accepted of God. For firſt we read, that Almighty God doth account that to be given and to be beſtowed upon himſelf, that
<pb n="404" facs="tcp:54673:209" rendition="simple:additions"/> that is beſtowed upon the Poor: For ſo doth the Holy Ghoſt teſtifie unto us by the Wiſe Man, ſaying, <hi>He that hath pity upon the Poor,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Prov. 19.</note> 
                        <hi>lendeth unto the Lord himſelf.</hi> And Chriſt in the Goſpel avoucheth, and as a moſt certain truth, bindeth it with an Oath, that the Alms beſtowed upon the Poor, was beſtowed upon him, and ſo ſhall be reckoned at the laſt day. For thus he ſaith to the charitable Alms-givers, when he ſitteth as Judge in the doom, to give ſentence of every man according to his deſerts:<note place="margin">Mat. 25.</note> 
                        <hi>Verily I ſay unto you, whatſoever good and merciful deed you did upon any of the leaſt of theſe my brethren, ye did the ſame unto me.</hi> In relieving their hunger, ye relieved mine; in quenching their thirſt, ye quenched mine; in clothing them, ye clothed me; and when ye har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boured them, ye lodged me alſo; when ye viſited them being ſick in Priſon, ye viſited me. For as he that hath received a Princes Embaſſadors, and entertaineth them well, doth honour the Prince from whom thoſe Embaſſadors do come: So he that receiveth the Poor and Needy, and helpeth them in their affliction and diſtreſs, doth thereby receive and honour Chriſt their Maſter, who as he was poor and needy himſelf whileſt he lived here amongſt us, to work the Myſtery of our Salvation, at his departure hence he promiſed in his ſtead to ſend un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to us thoſe that were Poor, by whoſe means his ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence ſhould be ſupplied: and therefore that we would do unto him, we muſt do unto them.

                        <hi>ſhall never be without poor men:</hi> becauſe he would have continual trial of his People, whether they loved him or no, that in ſhewing themſelves obedient unto his will, they might certainly aſſure themſelves of his love and favour towards them, and nothing doubt, but that as his Law and Ordinance (wherein he commanded them that they ſhould open their hand unto their brethren that were poor and needy in the Land) were accepted of them, and willingly performed:
<pb n="405" facs="tcp:54673:209" rendition="simple:additions"/> So he would on his part lovingly accept them, and truly perform his promiſes that he had made unto them.</p>
                     <p>The Holy Apoſtles and Diſciples of Chriſt, who by reaſon of his daily converſation, ſaw by his Deeds, and heard in his Doctrine, how much he tendred the Poor: the godly Fathers alſo, that were both before and ſince Chriſt, indued without doubt with the Holy Ghoſt, and moſt certainly certified of Gods Holy Will: they both do moſt earneſtly exhort us, and in all their writings almoſt continually admoniſh us, that we would remember the Poor, and beſtow our charitable Alms upon them.

Surely, as they were faithful to God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, and therefore diſcharged their Duty truly, in telling us what was Gods Will: ſo of a ſingular love to us-ward, they laboured not only to inform us, but alſo to perſwade us, that to give Alms, and to
<pb n="406" facs="tcp:54673:210" rendition="simple:additions"/> ſuccour the poor and needy, was a very acceptable thing, and an high Sacrifice to God, wherein he greatly delighted, and had a ſingular pleaſure.

                        <hi>Whoſo is merciful and giveth alms, he offereth the right thank-offering.</hi> And he addeth thereunto: <hi>The right thank-offering maketh the Altar fat, and a ſweet ſmell it is before the Higheſt, it is acceptable be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God, and ſhall never be forgotten.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And the truth of this Doctrine is verified by the examples of thoſe holy and charitable Fathers, of whom we read in the Scriptures, that they were given to merciful compaſſion towards the Poor, and charitable relieving of their neceſſities. Such a one was <hi>Abraham,</hi> in whom God had ſo great pleaſure, that he vouchſafed to come unto him in form of an Angel, and to be entertained of him at his Houſe. Such was his kinſman <hi>Lot,</hi> whom God ſo favoured for receiving his Meſſengers into his Houſe, which otherwiſe ſhould have lien in the ſtreet, that he ſaved him with his whole Family, from the deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of <hi>Sodom</hi> and <hi>Gomorrha.</hi> Such were the Holy Fathers, <hi>Job</hi> and <hi>Toby,</hi> with many others, who felt moſt ſenſible proofs of Gods ſpecial love towards them. And as all theſe by their mercifulneſs and ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der compaſſion which they ſhewed to the miſerable afflicted Members of Chriſt, in the relieving, helping, and ſuccouring them with their Temporal Goods in this life, obtained Gods favour, and were dear, accepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and pleaſant in his ſight: ſo now they themſelves take pleaſure in the fruition of God, in the pleaſant joys of Heaven, and are alſo in Gods eternal Word ſet before us, as perfect examples ever before our eyes, both how we ſhall pleaſe God in this mortal life, and alſo how we may come to live in joy with them in everlaſting pleaſure and felicity. For moſt true is that ſaying which <hi>Auguſtine</hi> hath, that the giving of Alms, and relieving of the Poor, is the right way to Heaven. <hi>Via Coeli pauper eſt. The Poor man</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>is the way to Heaven.</hi> They uſed in
<pb n="407" facs="tcp:54673:210" rendition="simple:additions"/> times paſt, to ſet in High-ways ſides the Picture of <hi>Mercury,</hi> pointing with his finger which was the right way to the Town. And we uſe in croſs-ways to ſet up a wooden or ſtone Croſs, to admoniſh the travel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling man which way he muſt turn when he cometh thither, to direct his Journey aright. But Gods Word (as St. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> ſaith) hath ſet in the way to Heaven the Poor Man and his Houſe, ſo that whoſo will go aright thither, and not turn out of the way, muſt go by the poor. The poor man is that <hi>Mercury</hi> that ſhall ſet us the ready way: and if we look well to this mark, we ſhall not wander much out of the right path. The manner of wiſe worldly men amongſt us is, that if they know a man of a meaner Eſtate than themſelves to be in favour with the Prince, or any other Noble-man, whom they either fear or love, ſuch a one they will be glad to benefit and pleaſure, that when they have need they may become their Spokeſman, either to obtain a commodity, or to eſcape a diſpleaſure. Now ſurely it ought to be a ſhame to us, that worldly men for temporal things, that laſt but for a ſeaſon, ſhould be more wiſe and provident in procuring them, than we in heavenly. Our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour Chriſt teſtifieth of poor men, that they are dear unto him, and that he loveth them eſpecially: For he calleth them his little ones, by a name of tender love: he ſaith they be his brethren.

<pb n="408" facs="tcp:54673:211" rendition="simple:additions"/> and refuſeth not to take them for his Servants, is both able to pleaſure and diſpleaſure us, and that we ſtand every hour in need of his help. Why ſhould we then be either negligent or unwilling to procure their friendſhip and favour, by the which alſo we may be aſſured to get his favour, that is both able and wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to do us all pleaſures that are for our commodity and wealth? Chriſt doth declare by this, how much he accepteth our charitable affection toward the Poor, in that he promiſeth a reward unto them that give but a cup of cold water in his name to them that have need thereof, and that reward is the Kingdom of Heaven. No doubt is it therefore that God regardeth highly, that which he rewardeth ſo liberally. For he that promiſeth a Princely recompence for a beggerly benevolence, declareth that he is more delighted with the giving, than with the gift, and that he as much eſteemeth the doing of the thing, as the fruit and commodity that cometh of it. Whoſo therefore hath hitherto neglected to give Alms, let him know that God now requireth it of him; and he that hath been liberal to the Poor, let him know that his godly do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings are accepted, and thankfully taken at Gods hands, which he will requite with double and treble. For ſo ſaith the Wiſe man: <hi>He which ſheweth mercy to the poor, doth lay his money in bank to the Lord, for a large intereſt and gain:</hi> the gain being chiefly the poſſeſſion of the life everlaſting, through the merits of our Saviour Jeſus Chriſt: To whom with the Father and the Holy Ghoſt, be all Honour and Glory for ever. <hi>Amen.</hi>

                     <head>The Second Part of the Sermon of Alms-deeds.</head>
                     <p>YE have heard before (Dearly Beloved) that to give Alms unto the Poor, and to help them in time of neceſſity, is ſo acceptable unto our Saviour Chriſt, that he counteth that to be done to himſelf,
<pb n="409" facs="tcp:54673:211" rendition="simple:additions"/> that we do for his ſake unto them. Ye have heard alſo how earneſtly both the Apoſtles, Prophets, Holy Fathers, and Doctors, do exhort us unto the ſame. And ye ſee how wel-beloved and dear unto God they were, whom the Scriptures report unto us to have been good Alms-men. Wherefore if either their good examples, or the wholſom counſel of godly Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, or the love of Chriſt, whoſe eſpecial favour we may be aſſured by this means to obtain, may move us, or do any thing at all with us: let us pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide us, that from henceforth we ſhew unto God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward this thankful ſervice, to be mindful and ready to help them that be poor and in miſery.</p>
                     <p>Now will I this ſecond time that I entreat of Alms-deeds, ſhew unto you how profitable it is for us to exerciſe them, and what fruit thereby ſhall ariſe unto us, if we do them faithfully. Our Saviour Chriſt in the Goſpel teacheth us, that it profiteth a man no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to have in poſſeſſion all the riches of the whole World, and the wealth or glory thereof, if in the mean ſeaſon he loſe his Soul, or do that thing where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by it ſhould become captive unto death, ſin, and hell<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fire. By the which ſaying, he not only inſtructeth us, how much the ſouls health is to be preferred before worldly commodities; but it alſo ſerveth to ſtir up our minds, and to prick us forwards to ſeek diligent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and learn by what means we may preſerve and keep our ſouls ever in ſafety: that is, how we may recover our health if it be loſt or impaired, and how it may be defended and maintained if once we have it. Yea, he teacheth us alſo thereby to eſteem that as a precious Medicine, and an ineſtimable Jewel that hath ſuch ſtrength and vertue in it, that can either procure or preſerve ſo incomparable a trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure. For if we greatly regard that Medicine or Salve that is able to heal ſundry and grievous Diſeaſes of the Body, much more will we eſteem that which hath like power over the Soul. And becauſe we might be better aſſured both to know and to have in readineſs that ſo profitable a Remedy: he, as a moſt
<pb n="410" facs="tcp:54673:212" rendition="simple:additions"/> faithful and loving Teacher, ſheweth himſelf both what it is, and where we may find it, and how we may uſe and apply it. For when both he and his Diſciples were grievouſly accuſed of the <hi>Phariſees,</hi> to have defiled their ſouls in breaking the conſtitutions of the Elders, becauſe they went to meat, and waſhed not their hands before, according to the cuſtom of the Jews: Chriſt anſwering their ſuperſtitious com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint, teacheth them an eſpecial remedy how to keep clean their ſouls, notwithſtanding the breach of ſuch ſuperſtitious Orders:<note place="margin">Luke 11.</note> 
                        <hi>Give Alms</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>and behold all things are clean unto you.</hi> He teacheth them, that to be merciful and charitable in helping the Poor, is the means to keep the Soul pure and clean in the ſight of God. We are taught therefore by this, that merciful Alms-dealing is profitable to purge the Soul from the infection and filthy ſpots of ſin. The ſame Leſſon doth the Holy Ghoſt alſo teach in ſundry places of the Scripture,<note place="margin">Tobit. 4.</note> ſaying, <hi>Mercifulneſs and Alms-giving purgeth from all ſins, and delivereth from death, and ſuffereth not the ſoul to come into darkneſs.</hi> A great confidence may they have before the high God, that ſhew mercy and compaſſion to them that are afflicted. The wiſe Preacher, the Son of <hi>Syrach,</hi> confimeth the ſame,<note place="margin">Ecclus 5.</note> when he ſaith, <hi>That as water quencheth burning fire, even ſo mercy and alms reſiſteth and reconcileth ſins.</hi> And ſure it is, that mercifulneſs quaileth the heat of ſin ſo much, that they ſhall not take hold upon man to hurt him; or if ye have by any infirmity or weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs been touched and annoyed with them, ſtraight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways ſhall mercifulneſs wipe and waſh away, as ſalves and remedies to heal their ſores and grievous diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes. And thereupon that Holy Father <hi>Cyprian</hi> ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth good occaſion to exhort earneſtly to the mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciful works of giving Alms and helping the Poor, and there he admoniſheth to conſider how whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom and profitable it is to relieve the needy, and help the afflicted, by the which we may purge our ſins, and heal our wounded ſouls.</p>
                     <p>But yet ſome will ſay unto me, If Alms-giving,
<pb n="411" facs="tcp:54673:212"/> and our charitable works towards the Poor, be able to waſh away ſins, to reconcile us to God, to deliver us from the peril of damnation, and makes us the Sons and Heirs of Gods Kingdom: then are Chriſts merits defaced, and his blood ſhed in vain; then are we juſtified by Works, and by our Deeds may we merit Heaven; then do we in vain believe that Chriſt died for to put away our ſins, and that he roſe for our juſtification, as St. <hi>Paul</hi> teacheth. But ye ſhall underſtand (Dearly Beloved) that neither thoſe pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of the Scripture before alledged, neither the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of the bleſſed Martyr <hi>Cyprian,</hi> neither any other godly and learned man, when they, in extol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling the dignity, profit, fruit, and effect of vertuous and liberal Alms, do ſay that it waſheth away ſins, and bringeth us to the favour of God, do mean, that our work and charitable deed, is the original cauſe of our acception before God; or that for the digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity or worthineſs thereof, our ſins may be waſhed away, and we purged and cleanſed of all the ſpots of our iniquity; for that were indeed to deface Chriſt, and to defraud him of his glory. But they mean this, and this is the underſtanding of thoſe and ſuch like ſayings, that God of his mercy and ſpecial favour to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards them whom he hath appointed to everlaſting ſalvation, hath ſo offered his grace eſpecially, and they have ſo received it fruitfully, that although by reaſon of their ſinful living outwardly, they ſeemed before to have been the Children of Wrath and Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, yet now the Spirit of God mightily working in them, unto obedience to Gods Will and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments, they declare by their outward deeds and life, in the ſhewing of mercy and charity (which cannot come but of the Spirit of God, and his eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial grace) that they are the undoubted Children of God, appointed to everlaſting life. And ſo, as by their wickedneſs and ungodly living, they ſhewed themſelves according to the judgment of men, which follow the outward appearance, to be Reprobates and Caſt-aways: So now by their Obedience unto
<pb n="412" facs="tcp:54673:213" rendition="simple:additions"/> Gods Holy Will, and by their mercifulneſs and ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der pity (wherein they ſhew themſelves to be like unto God, who is the Fountain and Spring of all mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy) they declare openly and manifeſtly unto the ſight of men, that they are the Sons of God, and elect of him unto ſalvation. For as the good fruit is not the cauſe that the Tree is good, but the Tree muſt firſt be good before it can bring forth good fruit: ſo the good deeds of Man are not the cauſe that maketh Man good, but he is firſt made good by the ſpirit and grace of God that effectually worketh in him, and afterward he bringeth forth good fruits. And then as the good fruit doth argue the goodneſs of the Tree, ſo doth the good and merciful deed of the man, argue and certainly prove the goodneſs of him that doth it, according to Chriſts ſayings: <hi>Ye ſhall know them by their fruits.</hi> And if any man will object, that evil and naughty men do ſometimes by their deeds appear to be very godly and vertuous: I will anſwer, ſo doth the Crab and Choak-Pear ſeem outwardly to have ſometime as fair a red, and as mellow a colour as the Fruit that is good indeed. But he that will bite and take a taſte, ſhall eaſily judge betwixt the ſour bitter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the one, and the ſweet ſavourineſs of the other. And as the true Chriſtian man, in thankfulneſs of his heart, for the redemption of his Soul purchaſed by Chriſts death, ſheweth kindly by the fruit of his Faith, his obedience to God: ſo the other, as a Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant with God, doth all for his own gain, thinking to win Heaven by the merit of his Works, and ſo defaceth and obſcureth the price of Chriſts Blodd, who only wrought our purgation. The meaning then of theſe ſayings in the Scriptures and other Holy Writings: <hi>Alms-deeds do waſh away our ſins,</hi> and <hi>mercy to the Poor doth blot out our offences,</hi> is, that we doing theſe things according to Gods Will and our Duty, have our ſins indeed waſhed away, and our offences blotted out: not for the worthineſs of them, but by the grace of God which worketh all in all, and that for the promiſe that God hath made
<pb n="413" facs="tcp:54673:213" rendition="simple:additions"/> to them that are obedient unto his Commandment, that he which is the truth, might be juſtified in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming the truth due to his promiſe. Alms-deeds do waſh away our ſins, becauſe God doth vouchſafe then to repute us as clean and pure, when we do them for his ſake, and not becauſe they deſerve or merit our purging, or for that they have any ſuch ſtrength and vertue in themſelves<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I know that ſome men, too much addict to the advancing of their works, will not be contented with this anſwer; and no marvel, for ſuch men can no anſwer content or ſuffice. Wherefore leaving them to their own wilful ſenſe, we will rather have regard to the reaſonable and godly, who as they moſt certainly know and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade themſelves, that all goodneſs, all bounty, all mercy, all benefits, all forgiveneſs of ſins, and what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever can be named good and profitable, either for the Body, or for the Soul, do come only of Gods mercy and meer favour, and not of themſelves: So though they do never ſo many and ſo excellent good deeds, yet are they never puft up with the vain con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence of them. And though they hear and read in Gods Word, and other-where in godly mens Works, that Alms-deeds, Mercy, and Charitableneſs, doth waſh away ſin, and blot out iniquity: yet do they not arrogantly and proudly ſtick and truſt unto them, or brag themſelves of them, as the proud <hi>Phariſee</hi> did, leſt with the <hi>Phariſee</hi> they ſhould be condemned: but rather with the humble and poor <hi>Publican,</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs themſelves ſinful wretches, unworthy to look up to Heaven, calling and craving for mercy, that with the <hi>Publican</hi> they may be pronounced of Chriſt to be juſtified. The godly do learn, that when the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures ſay, that by good and merciful works, we are reconciled to Gods favour: we are taught then to know what Chriſt by his interceſſion and mediation obtaineth for us of his Father, when we be obedient to his Will; yea, they learn in ſuch manner of ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a comfortable argument of Gods ſingular favour and love, that attributeth that unto us and to our
<pb n="414" facs="tcp:54673:214" rendition="simple:additions"/> doings, that he by his Spirit worketh in us, and through his grace procureth for us. And yet this notwithſtanding, they cry out with St. <hi>Paul, O wretches that we are: and acknowledge</hi> (as Chriſt teacheth) <hi>that when they have all done, they are but unprofitable ſervants:</hi> and with the bleſſed King <hi>David,</hi> in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of the juſt judgments of God, they do tremble, and ſay, <hi>Who ſhall be able to abide it, Lord, if thou wilt give ſentence according to our deſerts?</hi> Thus they humble themſelves, and are exalted of God: they count themſelves vile, and of God are counted pure and clean: they condemn themſelves, and are ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtified of God: they think themſelves unworthy of the Earth, and of God are thought worthy of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven. Thus by Gods Word are they truly taught how to think rightly of merciful dealing of Alms, and of Gods eſpecial mercy and goodneſs are made par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takers of thoſe fruits that his Word hath promiſed. Let us then follow their examples, and both ſhew obediently in our lives thoſe works of mercy that we are commanded, and have that right opinion and judgment of them that we are taught, and we ſhall in like manner, as they, be made partakers, and feel the fruits and rewards that follow ſuch godly living, ſo ſhall we know by proof what profit and commodity doth come of giving of Alms, and ſuccouring of the Poor.</p>

                     <head>The Third Part of the Sermon of Alms-Deeds.</head>
                     <p>YE have already heard two Parts of this Treatiſe of Alms-Deeds. The firſt, how pleaſant and acceptable before God the doing of them is; the ſecond, how much it behoveth us, and how profita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble it is to apply our ſelves unto them. Now in the third Part will I take away that let that hindreth many from doing them. There be many that when
<pb n="415" facs="tcp:54673:214" rendition="simple:additions"/> they hear how acceptable a thing in the ſight of God the giving of Alms is, and how much God ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendeth his favour towards them that are merciful, and what fruits and commodities doth come to them by it, they wiſh very gladly with themſelves that they alſo might obtain theſe benefits, and be counted ſuch of God as whom he would love or do for. But yet theſe men are with greedy Covetouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs ſo pulled back, that they will not beſtow one Half-penny, or one piece of Bread, that they might be thought worthy of Gods benefits, and ſo to come into his favour. For they are evermore fearful, and doubting, leſt by often giving, although it were but a little at a time, they ſhould conſume their Goods, and ſo impoveriſh themſelves, that even themſelves at the length ſhould not be able to live, but ſhould be driven to beg, and live of other mens Alms. And thus they ſeek excuſes to withhold themſelves from the favour of God, and chooſe with pinching Covetouſneſs, rather to lean unto the Devil, than by charitable Mercifulneſs, either to come unto Chriſt, or to ſuffer Chriſt to come unto them. O that we had ſome cunning and skilful Phyſician that were able to purge them of this ſo peſtilent an humour, that ſo ſore infecteth, not their bodies, but their minds, and ſo by corrupting their Souls, bringeth their bodies and ſouls into danger of Hell-fire. Now, leſt there be any ſuch among us (Dearly Beloved) let us diligently ſearch for that Phyſician, which is Jeſus Chriſt, and earneſtly labour that of his Mercy he will truly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruct us, and give us a preſent Remedy againſt ſo perillous a Diſeaſe. Hearken then, whoſoever thou art that feareſt leſt by giving to the Poor, thou ſhouldſt bring thy ſelf to beggery. That which thou takeſt from thy ſelf to beſtow upon Chriſt can never be conſumed and waſted away. Wherein thou ſhalt not believe me, but if thou have Faith, and be a true Chriſtian, believe the Holy Ghoſt, give credit to the Authority of Gods Word that
<pb n="416" facs="tcp:54673:215" rendition="simple:additions"/> thus teacheth. For thus ſaith the Holy Ghoſt by <hi>Solomon, He that giveth unto the Poor, ſhall never want.</hi> Men ſuppoſe that by hoording and laying up ſtill, they ſhall at length be Rich, and that by di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtributing and laying out, although it be for moſt neceſſary and godly uſes, they ſhall be brought to Poverty. But the Holy Ghoſt, which knoweth all truth, teacheth us another Leſſon, contrary to this. He teacheth us that there is a kind of diſpending that ſhall never diminiſh the ſtock, and a kind of ſaving that ſhall bring a man to extream poverty. For where he ſaith, <hi>that the good Alms-man ſhall ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver have ſcarcity,</hi> he addeth, <hi>But he that turneth away his eyes from ſuch as be in neceſſity, ſhall ſuffer great poverty himſelf.</hi> How far different then is the judgment of man from the judgment of the Holy Ghoſt?<note place="margin">1 Cor. 9.</note> The Holy Apoſtle <hi>Paul,</hi> a man full of the Holy Ghoſt, and made privy even of the ſecret Will of God, teacheth, that the liberal Alms-giver ſhall not thereby be impoveriſhed. <hi>He that miniſtreth</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>ſeed unto the ſower, will miniſter alſo bread unto you for food, yea, he will multiply your ſeed, and increaſe the fruits of your righteouſneſs.</hi> He is not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to advertiſe them that they ſhall not lack, but he ſheweth them alſo in what ſort God will provide for them. Even as he provided ſeed for the ſower in multiplying it, and giving great increaſe; ſo he will multiply their Goods and increaſe them, that there ſhall be great abundance. And leſt we ſhould think his ſayings to be but words, and not truth, we have an example thereof in the third Book of <hi>Kings,</hi> which doth confirm and ſeal it up as a moſt certain truth. <hi>The poor Widow that received the ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed Prophet of God,</hi> Elias, <hi>when as ſhe had but a handful of Meal in a Veſſel, and a little Oyl in a Cruiſe, whereof ſhe would make a Cake for her ſelf and her Son, that after they had eaten that, they might die, becauſe in that great Famine there was no more food to be gotten: yet when ſhe gave part thereof to</hi> Elias, <hi>and defrauded her own hungry belly mercifully to relieve
<pb n="417" facs="tcp:54673:215" rendition="simple:additions"/> him, ſhe was ſo bleſſed of God, that neither the Meal nor the Oyl was conſumed all the time while that Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine did laſt, but thereof both the Prophet</hi> Elias, <hi>ſhe, and her Son, were ſufficiently nouriſhed and had enough.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Oh conſider this Example, ye unbelieving and faithleſs covetous Perſons, who diſcredit Gods Word, and think his Power diminiſhed! This poor Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, in the time of an extream and long Dearth had but one handful of Meal, and a little cruſe of Oyl, her only Son was ready to periſh before her face for hunger, and ſhe her ſelf like to pine away: and yet when the poor Prophet came and asked part, ſhe was ſo mindful of mercifulneſs, that ſhe forgot her own miſery; and rather than ſhe would omit the occaſion given to give Alms, and work a work of Righteouſneſs, ſhe was content preſently to hazard her own and her Sons life. And you, who have great plenty of Meats and Drinks, great ſtore of Moth-eaten Apparel, yea, many of you great heaps of Gold and Silver, and he that hath leaſt hath more than ſufficient, now in this time, when (thanks be to God) no great Famine doth oppreſs you, your Children being well clothed, and well fed, and no danger of death for Famine to be feared, will rather caſt doubts and perils of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likely Penury, than you will part with any piece of your ſuperfluities, to help and ſuccour the poor, hungry, and naked Chriſt, that cometh to your doors a begging. This poor and ſilly Widow never caſt doubts in all her miſery what wants ſhe her ſelf ſhould have, ſhe never diſtruſted the promiſe that God made to her by the Prophet, but ſtraight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way went about to relieve the hungry Prophet of God, yea, preferring his neceſſity before her own. But we, like unbelieving wretches, before we will give one Mite, we will caſt a thouſand doubts of danger, whether that will ſtand us in any ſtead, that we give to the Poor; whether we ſhould not have need of it at any other time, and whether here it would not have been more profitably beſtowed. So
<pb n="418" facs="tcp:54673:216" rendition="simple:additions"/> that it is more hard to wrench a ſtrong Nail (as the Proverb ſaith) out of a Poſt, than to wring a farthing out of our fingers. There is neither the fear nor the love of God before our eyes; we will more eſteem a Mite, than we either deſire Gods Kingdom, or fear the Devils Dungeon. Hearken therefore, ye mercileſs Miſers, what will be the end of this your unmerciful dealing. As certainly as God nouriſhed this poor Widow in the Time of Famine, and increaſed her little ſtore, ſo that ſhe had enough, and felt no penury, when other pined away: ſo certainly ſhall God plague you with Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verty in the midſt of Plenty. Then when other have abundance, and be fed at full, you ſhall utterly waſte and conſume away your ſelves; your ſtore ſhall be deſtroyed, your goods pluckt from you, all your glory and wealth ſhall periſh: and that which when you had you might have enjoyed your ſelves in peace, and might have beſtowed upon other moſt godly, ye ſhall ſeek with ſorrow and ſighs, and no where ſhall find it. For your unmercifulneſs toward other, ye ſhall find no man that will ſhew mercy to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards you. You that had ſtony hearts towards other, ſhall find all the Creatures of God, to you ward as hard as Braſs and Iron. Alas, what fury and mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs doth poſſeſs our minds, that in a matter of truth and certainty, we will not give credit to the truth, teſtifying unto that which is moſt certain. Chriſt ſaith, <hi>That if we will firſt ſeek the Kingdom of God, and do the works of righteouſneſs thereof, we ſhall not be left deſtitute, all other things ſhall be given to us plenteouſly.</hi> Nay, ſay we, I will firſt look that I be able to live my ſelf, and be ſure that I have enough for me and mine, and if I have any thing over, I will beſtow it to get Gods favour, and the Poor ſhall then have part with me.</p>
                     <p>See, I pray you, the perverſe judgment of men, we have more care to nouriſh the Carcaſs, than we have fear to ſee our Soul periſh.<note place="margin">Sermon. de Eleemoſyna.</note> And as <hi>Cyprian</hi> ſaith, whileſt we ſtand in doubt leſt our Goods fail, in
<pb n="419" facs="tcp:54673:216" rendition="simple:additions"/> being over-liberal, we put it out of doubt, that our life and health faileth, in not being liberal at all. Whiles we are careful for diminiſhing of our ſtock, we are altogether careleſs to diminiſh our ſelves. We love Mammon and loſe our Souls. We fear leſt our Patrimony ſhould periſh from us, but we fear not leſt we ſhould periſh for it. Thus do we perverſly love that which we ſhould hate, and hate that which we ſhould love; we be negligent where we ſhould be careful, and careful where we need not Thus vain fear to lack our ſelves, if we give to the Poor, is much like the fear of Children and Fools, which when they ſee the bright glimmering of a Glaſs, they do imagine ſtraightway that it is the Lightning, and yet the brightneſs of a Glaſs never was the Light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning. Even ſo, when we imagine that by ſpend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon the Poor, a man may come to Poverty, we are caſt into a vain fear, for we never heard or knew, that by that means any man came to miſery, and was left deſtitute, and not conſidered of God. Nay, we read to the contrary in the Scripture (as I have before ſhewed, and as by infinite Teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies and Examples may be proved) that whoſoever ſerveth God faithfully and unfeignedly in any Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, God will not ſuffer him to decay, much leſs to periſh. The Holy Ghoſt teacheth us by <hi>Solomon,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Prov. 17.</note> 
                        <hi>that the Lord will not ſuffer the Soul of the righteous to periſh for hunger.</hi> And therefore <hi>David</hi> ſaith unto all them that are merciful, <hi>O fear the Lord ye that be his Saints, for they that fear him lack nothing, The Lions do lack and ſuffer hunger, but they which ſeek the Lord, ſhall want no manner of thing that is good.</hi> When <hi>Elias</hi> was in the Deſart,<note place="margin">3 Kings 17.</note> God fed him by the miniſtry of a Raven, that Evening and Morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing brought him ſufficient Victuals. When <hi>Daniel</hi> was ſhut up in the Lions Den, God prepared Meat for him, and ſent it thither to him And there was the ſaying of <hi>David</hi> fulfilled, <hi>The Lions do lack and ſuffer hunger, but they which ſeek the Lord ſhall want no good thing.</hi> For while the Lions, which
<pb n="420" facs="tcp:54673:217"/> ſhould have been fed with his fleſh, rored for hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger and deſire of their Prey, whereof they had no power, although it were preſent before them, he in the mean time was freſh fed from God, that ſhould with his fleſh have filled the Lions. So mightily doth God work to preſerve and maintain thoſe whom he loveth; ſo careful is he alſo to feed them who in any ſtate or vocation do unfeignedly ſerve him. And ſhall we now think that he will be unmindful of us, if we be obedient to his Word, and accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to his Will have pity on the Poor? He giveth us all wealth before we do any ſervice for it: and will he ſee us lack neceſſaries when we do him true ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice? Can a man think that he that feedeth Chriſt, can be forſaken of Chriſt, and left without food? Or will Chriſt deny earthly things unto them whom he promiſeth Heavenly things for his true ſervice? It cannot be therefore (Dear Brethren) that by giving of Alms, we ſhould at any time want our ſelves; or that we which relieve other mens need, ſhould our ſelves be oppreſſed with penury. It is contrary to Gods Word, it repugneth with his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, it is againſt Chriſts property and nature to ſuffer it, it is the crafty ſurmiſe of the Devil to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade us it. Wherefore ſtick not to give Alms freely, and truſt notwithſtanding, that Gods good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs will miniſter unto us ſufficiency and plenty, ſo long as we ſhall live in this tranſitory life, and after our days here well ſpent in his ſervice, and the love of our brethren, we ſhall be crowned with everlaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing glory, to reign with Chriſt our Saviour, in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven: to whom with the Father and the Holy Ghoſt, be all Honour and Glory for ever. <hi>Amen.</hi>

                  <p>AMong all the Creatures that God made in the beginning of the World moſt excellent and wonderful in their kind, there was none (as the Scripture beareth witneſs) to be compared al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt in any point unto Man, who as well in Body as Soul exceeded all other, no leſs than the Sun in brightneſs and light exceedeth every ſmall and little Star in the Firmament. He was made according to the Image and ſimilitude of God, he was endued with all kind of Heavenly gifts, he had no ſpot of uncleanneſs in him, he was ſound and perfect in all parts, both outwardly and inwardly, his Reaſon was uncorrupt, his Underſtanding was pure and good, his Will was obedient and godly, he was made al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together like unto God, in Righteouſneſs, and Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs, in Wiſdom, in Truth; to be ſhort, in all kind of perfection.</p>

                  <p>When he was thus created and made, Almighty God, in token of his great love towards him, choſe out a ſpecial place of the Earth for him, namely, Paradiſe, where he lived in all tranquillity and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, having great abundance of worldly goods, and lacking nothing that he might juſtly require or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire to have. For as it is ſaid, <hi>God made him Lord and Ruler over all the Works of his hands, that he ſhould have under his feet all Sheep and Oxen,</hi>

But as the common nature of all men is, in time of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperity and Wealth, to forget not only themſelves, but alſo God: Even ſo did this firſt man <hi>Adam,</hi> who having but one Commandment at Gods hand; name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that he ſhould not eat of the Fruit of Knowledge of Good and Ill, did notwithſtanding, moſt unmind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully, or rather moſt wilfully break it, in forgetting the ſtraight charge of his Maker, and giving ear to the crafty ſuggeſtion of that wicked Serpent the Devil. Whereby it came to paſs, that as before he was bleſſed, ſo now he was accurſed; as before he was loved, ſo now he was abhorred; as before he was moſt beautiful and precious, ſo now he was moſt vile and wretched in the ſight of his Lord and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker: Inſtead of the Image of God, he was now be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come the Image of the Devil; inſtead of the Citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zen of Heaven, he was become the bond-ſlave of Hell, having in himſelf no one part of his former purity and cleanneſs, but being altogether ſpotted and defiled; inſomuch that now he ſeemed to be nothing elſe but a lump of ſin, and th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="423" facs="tcp:54673:218"/> better have been born. But it fell not only on him, but alſo on his Poſterity and Children for ever, ſo that the whole brood of <hi>Adam</hi>'s fleſh ſhould ſuſtain the ſelf-ſame fall and puniſhment, which their fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>father by his offence moſt juſtly had deſerved. St. <hi>Paul,</hi> in the fifth Chapter to the <hi>Romans</hi> ſaith, <hi>By the offence of only</hi> Adam, <hi>the fault came upon all men to condemnation, and by one mans diſobedience many were made ſinners.</hi> By which words we are taught, that as in <hi>Adam</hi> all men univerſally ſinned, ſo in <hi>Adam</hi> all men univerſally received the reward of ſin; that is to ſay, became mortal, and ſubject unto death, having in themſelves nothing but everlaſting dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation both of Body and Soul. <hi>They became</hi> (as <hi>David</hi> ſaith) <hi>corrupt and abominable, they went all out of the way, there was none that did good, no not one.</hi> O what a miſerable and woful ſtate was this, that the ſin of one man ſhould deſtroy and condemn all men, that nothing in all the World might be looked for, but only pangs of death, and pains of Hell? Had it been any marvel if mankind had been utterly driven to deſperation, being thus fallen from life to death, from ſalvation to deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, from Heaven to Hell? But behold the great goodneſs and tender mercy of God in his behalf: albeit mans wickedneſs and ſinful behaviour was ſuch, that it deſerved not in any part to be forgiven; yet to the intent he might not be clean deſtitute of all hope and comfort in time to come, he ordained a new Covenant, and made a ſure Promiſe thereof, namely, that he would ſend a Meſſias or Mediator into the World, which ſhould make interceſſion, and put himſelf as a ſtay between both Parties, to pacifie the wrath and indignation conceived againſt ſin, and to deliver man out of the miſerable curſe and curſed miſery, whereinto he was fallen head<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long by diſobeying the Will and Commandment of the only Lord and Maker. This Covenant and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe was firſt made unto <hi>Adam</hi> himſelf immediately after his Fall, as we read in the third of <hi>Geneſis,</hi>
                     <pb n="424" facs="tcp:54673:219"/> where God ſaid to the Serpent on this wiſe, <hi>I will put enmity between thee and the woman, between thy ſeed and her ſeed. He ſhall break thine head, and thou ſhalt bruiſe his heel.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Afterward the ſelf-ſame Covenant was alſo more amply and plainly renewed unto <hi>Abraham,</hi> where God promiſed him, <hi>that in his ſeed all Nations and Families of the Earth ſhould be bleſſed.</hi> Again, it was continued and confirmed unto <hi>Iſaac</hi> in the ſame form of words,<note place="margin">Gen. 26.</note> as it was before unto his Father. And to the intent that mankind might not deſpair, but always live in hope, Almighty God never cea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to publiſh, repeat, confirm, and continue the ſame, by divers and ſundry teſtimonies of his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets; who for the better perſwaſion of the thing, propheſied the time, the place, the manner and circumſtance of his Birth, the affliction of his Life, the kind of his Death, the glory of his Reſurrection, the receiving of his Kingdom, the deliverance of his People, with all other circumſtances belonging thereunto. <hi>Iſaiah</hi> propheſied <hi>that he ſhould be born of a Virgin, and called</hi> Emanuel. <hi>Micheas</hi> prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſied <hi>that he ſhould be born in</hi> Bethlehem, <hi>a place of</hi> Jury. <hi>Ezekiel</hi> propheſied <hi>that he ſhould come of the ſtock and linage of</hi> David. <hi>Daniel</hi> propheſied <hi>that all Nations and Languages ſhould ſerve him. Zachary</hi> propheſied <hi>that he ſhould come in poverty, riding upon an Aſs. Malachy</hi> propheſied <hi>that he ſhould ſend</hi> Elias <hi>before him, which was</hi> John <hi>the Baptiſt. Jeremy</hi> propheſied <hi>that he ſhould be ſold for Thirty Pieces of Silver,</hi> &amp;c. And all this was done, that the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe and Covenant of God, made unto <hi>Abraham</hi> and his Poſterity concerning the Redemption of the World, might be credited and fully believed. <hi>Now,</hi> as the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>when the fulneſs of time was come,</hi> that is, the perfection and courſe of years, appointed from the beginning, <hi>th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Which one benefit among all other is ſo great and wonderful, that neither Tongue can well expreſs it, neither Heart think it, much leſs give ſufficient thanks to God for it. But here is a great controverſie be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween us and the Jews, whether the ſaine Jeſus which was born of the Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> be the true Meſſias, and true Saviour of the World, ſo long promiſed and propheſied of before. They, as they are, and have been always proud and ſtiff-necked, would never acknowledge him until this day, but have looked and waited for another to come. They have this fond imagination in their heads, That the Meſſias ſhall come, not as Chriſt did, like
<pb n="426" facs="tcp:54673:220"/> a poor Pilgrim and meek ſoul riding upon an Aſs; but like a valiant and mighty King in great Royalty and Honour. Not as Chriſt did, with a few Fiſhermen, and men of ſmall eſtimation in the World: but with a great Army of ſtrong men, with a great train of Wiſe and Noble men, as Knights, Lords, Earls, Dukes, Princes, and ſo forth. Neither do they think that their Meſſias ſhall ſlanderouſly ſuffer death, as Chriſt did: but that he ſhall ſtoutly conquer, and manfully ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>due all his Enemies, and finally obtain ſuch a Kingdom on Earth, as never was ſeen from the beginning. While they feign unto themſelves after this ſort a Meſſias of their own brain, they deceive themſelves, and account Chriſt as an abject and ſcorn of the World. <hi>Therefore Chriſt crucified</hi> (as St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith) <hi>is unto the Jews a ſtumbling-block, and to the Gentiles fooliſhneſs, becauſe they think it an abſurd thing, and contrary to all reaſon, that a Redeemer and Saviour of the whole World, ſhould be handled after ſuch a ſort as he was; namely, ſcorned, reviled, ſcourged, condemned, and laſt of all cruelly hanged.</hi> This, I ſay, ſeemed in their eyes ſtrange, and moſt abſurd, and therefore neither they would at that time, neither will they as yet, acknowledge Chriſt to be their Meſſi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

But we (dearly beloved) that hope and look to be ſaved, muſt both ſtedfaſtly believe, and alſo boldly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs, that the ſame Jeſus, which was born of the Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> was the true Meſſias and Mediator between God and Man, promiſed and propheſied of ſo long before. For as the Apoſtle writeth, <hi>With the heart man believeth unto righteouſneſs,</hi>

                     <hi>and with the mouth confeſſion is made unto ſalvation.</hi> Again in the ſame place, <hi>Whoſoever believeth in him, ſhall never be aſhamed nor confounded.</hi> Whereto alſo agreeth the teſtimony of St. <hi>John,</hi> written in the fourth Chapter of his firſt general Epiſtle, on this wiſe: <hi>Whoſoever confeſſeth that Jeſus is the Son of God, he dwelleth in God, and God in him.</hi>

                  <p>There is no doubt, but in this point all Chriſtian men are fully and perfectly perſwaded. Yet ſhall it not be a loſt labour to inſtruct and furniſh you with a few places concerning this matter, that ye may be able to ſtop the blaſphemous mouths of all them that moſt Jewiſhly, or rather deviliſhly, ſhall at any time go about to teach or maintain the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary. Firſt, ye have the witneſs and teſtimony of the Angel <hi>Gabriel,</hi> declared as well to <hi>Zachary</hi> the High-Prieſt, as alſo to the bleſſed Virgin. Secondly, ye have the witneſs and teſtimony of <hi>John</hi> the Baptiſt, pointing unto Chriſt, and ſaying, <hi>Behold the Lamb of God that taketh away the ſins of the World.</hi> Thirdly, ye have the witneſs and teſtimony of God the Father, who thundred from Heaven, and ſaid, <hi>This is my dearly beloved Son, in whom I am well pleaſed, hear him.</hi> Fourthly, ye have the witneſs and teſtimony of the Holy Ghoſt, which came down from Heaven in manner of a Dove, and lighted upon him in time of his Baptiſm. To theſe might be added a great number more, namely, the witneſs and teſtimony of the Wiſe Men that came to <hi>Herod,</hi> the witneſs and teſtimony of <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meon</hi> and <hi>Anna,</hi> the witneſs and teſtimony of <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drew</hi> and <hi>Philip, Nathaniel</hi> and <hi>Peter, Nicodemus</hi> and <hi>Martha,</hi> with divers other: But it were too long to repeat all, and a few places are ſufficient in ſo plain a matter, ſpecially among them that are already perſwaded. Therefore if the privy Imps of Antichriſt, and crafty Inſtruments of the Devil, ſhall attempt or go about to withdraw you from this true Meſſias, and perſwade you to look for another that is not yet come; let them not in any caſe ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce you, but confirm your ſelves with theſe and ſuch other teſtimonies of Holy Scripture, which are ſo ſure and certain, that all the Devils in Hell ſhall never be able to withſtand them. For as truly as God liveth, ſo truly was Jeſus Chriſt the true Meſſias and Saviour of the World, even the ſame Jeſus which as this day was born of the Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi>
                     <pb n="428" facs="tcp:54673:221"/> without all help of man, only by the power and operation of the Holy Ghoſt.</p>
                  <p>Concerning whoſe nature and ſubſtance, becauſe divers and ſundry Hereſies are riſen in theſe our days, through the motion and ſuggeſtion of Satan: therefore it ſhall be needful and profitable for your inſtruction, to ſpeak a word or two alſo of this part. We are evidently taught in the Scripture, that our Lord and Saviour Chriſt conſiſteth of two ſeveral natures, of his manhood, being thereby perfect man; and of his Godhead, being thereby perfect God.<note place="margin">John 1. Rom. 8.</note> It is written, <hi>The Word,</hi> that is to ſay, the ſecond Perſon in Trinity, <hi>became fleſh. God ſending his own Son in the ſimilitude of ſinful fleſh, fulfilled thoſe things which the Law could not.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Phil. 2.</note> 
                     <hi>Chriſt being in form of God, took on him the form of a ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant, and was made like unto man, being found in ſhape as a man.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">1 Tim. 3.</note> 
                     <hi>God was ſhewed in Fleſh, juſtified in Spirit, ſeen of Angels, preached to the Gentiles, believed on in the World, and received up in glory.</hi> Alſo in another place: <hi>There is one God, and one Mediator between God and man, even the Man Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> Theſe be plain places for the proof and declaration of both Natures, united and knit toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in one Chriſt. Let us diligently conſider and weigh the works that he did whiles he lived on Earth, and we ſhall thereby alſo perceive the ſelf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſame thing to be moſt true. In that he did hunger and thirſt, eat and drink, ſleep and wake, in that he preached his Goſpel to the People, in that he wept and ſorrowed for <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> in that he paid Tribute for himſelf and <hi>Peter,</hi> in that he died and ſuffered death: what other things did he elſe declare, but only this, that he was perfect man as we are? For which cauſe he is called in Holy Scripture ſometime the Son of <hi>David,</hi> ſometime the Son of Man, ſometime the Son of <hi>Mary,</hi> ſometime the Son of <hi>Joſeph,</hi> and ſo forth. Now, in that he for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gave Sins, in that he wrought Miracles, in that he did caſt out Devils, in that he healed men with his
<pb n="429" facs="tcp:54673:221"/> only Word, in that he knew the thoughts of mens Hearts, in that he had the Seas at his Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, in that he walked on the Water, in that he roſe from Death to Life, in that he aſcended into Heaven, and ſo forth. What other thing did he ſhew therein but only that he was perfect God, co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>equal with the Father as touching his Deity? There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he ſaith, <hi>The Father and I are all one,</hi> which is to be underſtood of his Godhead. For as touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his Manhood, he ſaith, <hi>The Father is greater than I am.</hi> Where are now thoſe <hi>Marcionites,</hi> that deny Chriſt to have been born in the fleſh, or to have been perfect man? Where are now thoſe <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi> which deny Chriſt to have been perfect God, of equal ſubſtance with the Father? If there be any ſuch, we may eaſily reprove them with theſe teſtimonies of Gods Word and ſuch other. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto I am moſt ſure, they ſhall never be able to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer. For the neceſſity of our Salvation did re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire ſuch a Mediator and Saviour, as under one Perſon ſhould be a partaker of both Natures: It was requiſite he ſhould be Man, it was alſo requiſite he ſhould be God. For as the tranſgreſſion came by man, ſo was it meet the ſatisfaction ſhould be made by man. And becauſe death, according to St. <hi>Paul,</hi> is the juſt ſtipend and reward of ſin, therefore to appeaſe the wrath of God, and to ſatisfie his Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice, it was expedient that our Mediator ſhould be ſuch a one, as might take upon him the ſins of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, and ſuſtain the due puniſhment thereof, namely, Death. Moreover, he came in fleſh, and in the ſelf-ſame fleſh aſcended into Heaven, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare and teſtifie unto us, that all faithful People which ſtedfaſtly believe in him, ſhall likewiſe come unto the ſame Manſion-place, whereunto he being our chief Captain, is gone before. Laſt of all, he became man, that we thereby might receive the greater comfort, as well in our Prayers, as alſo in our Adverſity, conſidering with our ſelves, that we have a Mediator that is true man as we are, who
<pb n="430" facs="tcp:54673:222"/> alſo is touched with our Infirmities, and was tempted even in like ſort as we are. For theſe and ſundry other cauſes, it was moſt needful he ſhould come, as he did in the fleſh.</p>
                  <p>But becauſe no creature, in that he is only a creature, hath or may have power to deſtroy death, and give life; to overcome Hell, and purchaſe Heaven; to remit Sins, and give Righteouſneſs: therefore it was needful, that our Meſſias, whoſe proper Duty and Office that was, ſhould be not only full and perfect Man, but alſo full and perfect God, to the intent he might more fully and perfectly make ſatisfaction for mankind.<note place="margin">Mat. 3.</note> God ſaith, <hi>This is my wel-beloved Son, in whom I am well pleaſed.</hi> By which place we learn, that Chriſt appeaſed and quenched the wrath of his Father, not in that he was only the Son of Man: But much more in that he was the Son of God.</p>
                  <p>Thus ye have heard declared out of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, that Jeſus Chriſt was the true Meſſias and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour of the World, that he was by Nature and Subſtance perfect God and perfect Man; and for what cauſe it was expedient it ſhould be ſo. Now, that we may be the more mindful and thankful un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to God in this behalf, let us briefly conſider, and call to mind the manifold and great benefits that we have received by the Nativity and Birth of this our Meſſias and Saviour.</p>
                  <p>Before Chriſt coming into the World, all men univerſally in <hi>Adam,</hi> were nothing elſe but a wicked and crooked Generation, rotten and corrupt Trees, ſtony Ground, full of Brambles and Briers, loſt Sheep, Prodigal Sons, naughty unprofitable Servants, unrighteous Stewards, workers of Iniquity, the brood of Adders, blind Guides, ſitting in Darkneſs and in the ſhadow of Death: to be ſhort, nothing elſe but Children of Perdition, and inheritors of Hell-fire. To this doth St. <hi>Paul</hi> bear witneſs in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers places of his Epiſtles, and Chriſt alſo himſelf in ſundry places of his Goſpel. But after he was
<pb n="431" facs="tcp:54673:222"/> once come down from Heaven, and had taken our frail Nature upon him, he made all them that would receive him truly, and believe his word, good Trees, and good Ground, fruitful and pleaſant Branches, Children of Light, Citizens of Heaven, Sheep of his Fold, Members of his Body, Heirs of his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, his true Friends and Brethren, ſweet and lively Bread, the elect and choſen People of God. For as St. <hi>Peter</hi> ſaith in his firſt Epiſtle, and ſecond Chapter: <hi>He bare our ſins in his body upon the Croſs, he healed us, and made us whole by his ſtripes: and whereas before we were ſheep going aſtray, he by his coming brought us home again to the true Shepherd and Biſhop of our Souls, making us a choſen Genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, a Royal Prieſthood, an Holy Nation, a parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular People of God, in that he died for our Offences, and roſe for our Juſtification.</hi> St. <hi>Paul</hi> to <hi>Timothy</hi> the third Chapter, <hi>We were</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>in times paſt, unwiſe, diſobedient, deceived, ſerving divers luſts and pleaſures, living in hatred, envy, maliciouſneſs,</hi> and ſo forth.</p>
                  <p>But after the loving kindneſs of God our Saviour appeared towards mankind, not according to the Righteouſneſs that we had done, but according to his great Mercy, he ſaved us by the Fountain of the new Birth, and by the renewing of the Holy Ghoſt, which he poured upon us abundantly, through Jeſus Chriſt our Saviour, that we being once Juſtified by his grace, ſhould be Heirs of Eternal Life, through hope and faith in his blood.</p>
                  <p>In theſe and ſuch other places, is ſet out before our Eyes, as it were in a Glaſs,<note place="margin">Mat. 2. Mat. 5. John 18. Luke 4. John 8. Mat. 9. Mat. 11. John 12. Coloſſ. 1.</note> the abundant grace of God, received in Chriſt Jeſu, which is ſo much the more wonderful, becauſe it came not of any de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſert of ours, but of his meer and tender mercy, even then when we were his extream Enemies: But for the better underſtanding and conſideration of this thing, let us behold the end of his coming, ſo ſhall we perceive what great commodity and profit his Nativity hath brought unto us miſerable and ſinful
<pb n="432" facs="tcp:54673:223" rendition="simple:additions"/> creatures.<note place="margin">Heb. 10. Rom. 3.</note> The end of his coming, was to ſave and deliver his People, to fulfil the Law for us, to bear witneſs unto the Truth, to teach and preach the words of his Father, to give light unto the World, to call ſinners to Repentance, to refreſh them that labour and be heavy laden, to caſt out the Prince of this World, to reconcile us in the body of his fleſh, to diſſolve the works of the Devil; laſt of all, to become a Propitiation for our ſins, and not for ours only, but alſo for the ſins of the whole World.</p>
                  <p>Theſe were the chief ends wherefore Chriſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came man, not for any profit that ſhould come to himſelf thereby, but only for our ſakes, that we might underſtand the Will of God, be partakers of his Heavenly Light, be delivered out of the Devils claws, releaſed from the burden of ſin, juſtified through faith in his blood, and finally, received up into everlaſting glory, there to reign with him for ever. Was not this a great and ſingular love of Chriſt towards mankind, that being the expreſs and lively Image of God, he would notwithſtanding humble himſelf, and take upon him the form of a Servant, and that only to ſave and redeem us? O how much are we bound to the goodneſs of God in this behalf? how many thanks and praiſes do we owe unto him for this our Salvation wrought by his dear and only Son Chriſt? who became a Pilgrim in Earth to make us Citizens in Heaven; who became the Son of man to make us the Sons of God; who became obedient to the Law, to deliver us from the curſe of the Law; who became poor, to make us rich; vile, to make us precious; ſubject to death, to make us live for ever. What greater love could we ſilly Creatures deſire or wiſh to have at Gods hands?</p>
                  <p>Therefore (Dearly Beloved) let us not forget this exceeding love of our Lord and Saviour, let us not ſhew our ſelves unmindful or unthankful to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward him: but let us love him, fear him, obey him, and ſerve him. Let us confeſs him with our Mouths,
<pb n="433" facs="tcp:54673:223"/> praiſe him with our Tongues, believe on him with our Hearts, and glorifie him with our good Works. Chriſt is the light, let us receive the light. Chriſt is the truth, let us believe the truth. Chriſt is the way, let us follow the way. And becauſe he is our only Maſter, our only Teacher, our only Shepherd, and chief Captain; therefore let us become his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, his Scholars, his Sheep, and his Souldiers. As for Sin, the Fleſh, the World, and the Devil, whoſe Servants and Bond-ſlaves we were before Chriſts coming, let us utterly caſt them off, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie them, as the chief and only Enemies of our Soul. And ſeeing we are once delivered from their cruel Tyranny by Chriſt, let us never fall into their hands again, leſt we chance to be in a worſe caſe than ever we were before. <hi>Happy are they,</hi> ſaith the Scripture, <hi>that continue to the end. Be faithful</hi> (ſaith God) <hi>until death, and I will give thee a crown of life.</hi> Again, he ſaith in another place, <hi>He that putteth his hand unto the Plough, and looketh back, is not meet for the Kingdom of God.</hi> There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore let us be ſtrong, ſtedfaſt, and unmoveable, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bounding always in the works of the Lord. Let us receive Chriſt, not for a time, but for ever; let us believe his Word, not for a time, but for ever; let us become his Servants, not for a time, but for ever; in conſideration that he hath redeemed and ſaved us, not for a time, but for ever; and will receive us into his Heavenly Kingdom, there to reign with him, not for a time, but for ever. To him there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore with the Father and the Holy Ghoſt, be all Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, Praiſe, and Glory, for ever and ever. <hi>Amen.</hi>

                     <hi>AN HOMILY FOR</hi> Good-Friday, concerning the Death and Paſſion of our Saviour Jeſus Chriſt.</head>
                  <p>IT ſhould not become us (well-beloved in Chriſt) being that People which he redeemed from the Devil, from Sin and Death, and from everlaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Damnation, by Chriſt, to ſuffer this time to paſs forth without any meditation and remembrance of that excellent Work of our Redemption, wrought as about this time, through the great mercy and cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of our Saviour Jeſus Chriſt, for us wretched Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, and his mortal Enemies. For if a mortal mans deed, done to the behoof of the Common-wealth, be had in remembrance of us, with thanks for the benefit and profit which we receive thereby: how much more readily ſhould we have in memory this excellent act and benefit of Chriſts death? whereby he hath purchaſed for us the undoubted pardon and forgiveneſs of our ſins, whereby he made at one the Father of Heaven with us, in ſuch wiſe, that he ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth us now for his loving Children, and for the true inheritors, with Chriſt his Natural Son, of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of Heaven. And verily ſo much more doth
<pb n="435" facs="tcp:54673:224"/> Chriſts kindneſs appear unto us, in that it pleaſed him to deliver himſelf of all his goodly Honour, which he was equally in with his Father in Heaven, and to come down into this vale of miſery, to be made mortal man, and to be in the ſtate of a moſt low Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant, ſerving us for our wealth and profit; us, I ſay, which were his ſworn Enemies, which had renoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced his holy Law and Commandments, and followed the luſts and ſinful pleaſures of our corrupt Nature. And yet, I ſay,<note place="margin">Coloſſ. 2.</note> did Chriſt put himſelf between Gods deſerved wrath, and our ſin; and rent that Obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion wherein we were in danger to God, and paid our debt. Our debt was a great deal too great for us to have paid. And without payment, God the Father could never be at one with us. Neither was it poſſible to be looſed from this debt by our own ability. It pleaſed him therefore to be the payer thereof, and to diſcharge us quite.</p>
                  <p>Who can now conſider the grievous debt of ſin, which could none otherwiſe be paid, but by the death of an Innocent, and will not hate ſin in his heart? If God hateth ſin ſo much, that he would allow neither man nor Angel for the Redemption thereof, but only the death of his only and well-beloved Son: who will not ſtand in fear thereof? If we (my Friends) conſider this, that for our ſins this moſt innocent Lamb was driven to death, we ſhall have much more cauſe to bewail our ſelves that we were the cauſe of his death, than to cry out of the malice and cruelty of the Jews, which purſued him to his death. We did the deeds wherefore he was thus ſtricken and wounded, they were only the miniſters of our wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. It is meet then that we ſhould ſtep low down into our hearts, and bewail our own wretchedneſs and ſinful living. Let us know for a certainty, that if the moſt dearly beloved Son of God was thus puniſhed and ſtricken for the ſin which he had not done him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf: how much more ought we ſore to be ſtricken for our daily and manifold ſins which we commit againſt God, if we earneſtly repent us not, and be not
<pb n="436" facs="tcp:54673:225"/> ſorry for them? No man can love ſin, which God hateth ſo much, and be in his favour. No man can ſay that he loveth Chriſt truly, and have his great Enemy (ſin I mean, the author of his death) familiar and in friendſhip with him. So much do we love God and Chriſt, as we hate ſin. We ought therefore to take great heed, that we be not favourers thereof, leſt we be found Enemies to God, and Traytors to Chriſt. For not only they which nailed Chriſt upon the Croſs, are his tormentors and crucifiers:<note place="margin">Heb. 6.</note>

For no doubt, all our thoughts and deeds were of no value, if they were nor allowed in the merits of Chriſts death.

                     <hi>For not to us</hi> (ſaith <hi>David) not to us, but to thy Name give the glory, O Lord.</hi> Let us therefore (good Friends) with all reverence glorifie his Name, let us magnifie and praiſe him for ever.

Let us there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore now open our hearts again to him, and ſtudy in our lives to be thankful to ſuch a Lord, and evermore to be mindful of ſo great a benefit;<note place="margin">Acts 17.</note> yea, let us take up our Croſs with Chriſt, and follow him. His Paſſion is not only the ranſom and whole amends for our ſin, but it is alſo a moſt perfect example of all patience and ſufferance. For if it behoved Chriſt thus to ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer, and to enter into the glory of his Father: why
<pb n="439" facs="tcp:54673:226"/> ſhould it not become us to bear patiently our ſmall croſſes of adverſity, and the troubles of this World? <hi>For ſurely</hi> (as ſaith St. <hi>Peter) Chriſt therefore ſuffered,</hi>

Let us not ſo much behold the pain, as the reward that ſhall follow that labour. Nay, let us rather endeavour our ſelves in our ſufferance, to endure innocently and guiltleſs, as our Saviour Chriſt did.

It becometh not Chriſtian men to be hard one to another, nor yet to think their Neighbour unworthy to be forgiven. For howſoever unworthy he is, yet is Chriſt worthy to have thee do thus much for his ſake, he hath deſerved it of thee, that thou ſhouldeſt forgive thy Neighbour. And God is alſo to be obeyed, which commandeth us to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give, if we will have any part of the Pardon which our Saviour Chriſt purchaſed once of God the Father, by ſhedding of his precious Blood.

For he ſitteth on the right hand of God his Father, as our Proctor and Attorney, pleading and ſuing for us in all our needs and neceſſities. Wherefore, if we we want any gift of godly wiſdom, we may ask it of God for Chriſts ſake, and we ſhall have it. Let us conſider and examine our ſelves, in what want we be concerning this virtue of Charity and Patience. If we ſee that our hearts be nothing inclined thereunto, in forgiving them that have offended againſt us, then let us knowledge our want, and wiſh to God to have it. But if we want it, and ſee in our ſelves no deſire thereunto, verily we be in a dangerous caſe before God, and have need to make much earneſt Prayer to God, that we may have ſuch an heart changed, to the grafting in of a new. For unleſs we forgive other, we ſhall never be forgiven of God. No, not all the prayers and good works of other, can pacifie God unto us, unleſs we be at peace, and at one with our Neighbour. Nor all our deeds and good works can move God to forgive us our debts to him, except we forgive to other. He ſetteth more by Mercy, than by Sacrifice.

                  <p>THAT we may the better conceive the great mercy and goodneſs of our Saviour Chriſt, in ſuffering death univerſally for all men, it behoveth us to deſcend into the bottom of our Conſcience, and deeply to conſider the firſt and prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal cauſe wherefore he was compelled ſo to do. When our great Grandfather <hi>Adam</hi> had broken Gods Commandment,<note place="margin">Gen. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>

For it was ſaid unto him,<note place="margin">Gen. 2.</note> 
                     <hi>Thou ſhalt eat freely of every Tree in the Garden: but as touching the Tree of knowledge of good and ill, thou ſhalt in no wiſe eat of it: For in what hour ſoever thou eateſt thereof, thou ſhalt die the death.</hi> Now as the Lord had ſpoken, ſo it came to paſs. <hi>Adam</hi> took upon him to eat thereof, and in ſo doing he died the death; that is to ſay, he became
<pb n="444" facs="tcp:54673:229"/> mortal, he loſt the favour of God, he was caſt out of Paradiſe, he was no longer a Citizen of Heaven; but a Fire-brand of Hell, and a Bondſlave to the Devil. To this doth our Saviour bear witneſs in the Goſpel,<note place="margin">Luke 15.</note> calling us <hi>loſt Sheep, which have gone aſtray, and wandred from the true Shepherd of our ſouls.</hi> To this alſo doth St. <hi>Paul</hi> bear witneſs,<note place="margin">Rom. 5.</note> ſaying, <hi>That by the offence only of</hi> Adam, <hi>death came upon all men to condemnation.</hi> So that now neither he, or any of his, had any right or intereſt at all in the Kingdom of Heaven; but were become plain Reprobates and Caſt-aways, being perpetually damned to the ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting pains of Hell-fire. In this ſo great miſery and wretchedneſs, if mankind could have recovered him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf again, and obtained forgiveneſs at Gods hands, then had his caſe been ſomewhat tolerable, becauſe he might have attempted ſome way how to deliver himſelf from eternal death. But there was no way left unto him, he could do nothing that might pacifie Gods wrath, he was altogether unprofitable in that behalf. <hi>There was not one that did good, no not one.</hi> And how then could he work his own Salvation? Should he go about to pacifie Gods heavy diſpleaſure by offering up burnt-ſacrifices,<note place="margin">Heb. 9.</note> according as it was ordained in the old Law? <hi>by offering up the blood of Oxen, the blood of Calves, the blood of Goats, the blood of Lambs,</hi> and ſo forth? O theſe things were of no force nor ſtrength to take away ſins, they could not put away the anger of God, they could not cool the heat of his wrath nor yet bring mankind into favour again, they were but only figures and ſhadows of things to come,<note place="margin">Heb. 10.</note> and nothing elſe. Read the Epiſtle to the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> there ſhall you find this matter largely diſcuſſed, there ſhall you learn in moſt plain words, that the bloody Sacrifice of the old Law was unperfect, and not able to deliver man from the ſtate of damnation by any means: ſo that mankind in truſting thereunto, ſhould truſt to a broken ſtaff, and in the end deceive himſelf. What ſhould he then do? Should he go about to ſerve and keep the Law of
<pb n="445" facs="tcp:54673:229"/> God divided into two Tables, and ſo purchaſe to himſelf eternal life? Indeed, if <hi>Adam</hi> and his Poſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity had been able to ſatisfie and fulfil the Law per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly, in loving God above all things, and their Neighbour as themſelves; then ſhould they have eaſily quenched the Lords wrath, and eſcaped the terrible ſentence of eternal death pronounced againſt them by the mouth of Almighty God. For it is writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, <hi>Do thus, and thou ſhalt live;</hi> that is to ſay,<note place="margin">Luke 10.</note> fulfil my Commandments, keep thy ſelf upright and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect in them according to my Will, then ſhalt thou live, and not die. Here is eternal life promiſed with this condition, and ſo, that they keep and obſerve the Law. But ſuch was the frailty of mankind after his Fall, ſuch was his weakneſs and imbecillity, that he could not walk uprightly in Gods Commandments, though he would never ſo fain: but daily and hourly fell from his bounden duty, offending the Lord his God divers ways, to the great increaſe of his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation, inſomuch that the Prophet <hi>David</hi> crieth out on this wiſe: <hi>All have gone aſtray,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Pſal. 5.</note> 
                     <hi>all are become unprofitable, there is none that doth good, no not one.</hi> In this caſe what profit could he have by the Law? None at all. For as St. <hi>James</hi> ſaith,<note place="margin">James 2.</note> 
                     <hi>He that ſhall ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve the whole Law, and yet faileth in one point, is become guilty of all.</hi> And in the Book of <hi>Deuteronomy</hi> it is written,<note place="margin">Deut. 27.</note> 
                     <hi>Curſed be he</hi> (ſaith God) <hi>which abideth not in all things that are written in the Book of the Law, to do them.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Behold, the Law bringeth a curſe with it, and maketh it guilty, not becauſe it is of it ſelf naught or unholy, (God forbid we ſhould ſo think) but becauſe the frailty of our ſinful fleſh is ſuch, that we can never fulfil it, according to the perfection that the Lord requireth. Could <hi>Adam</hi> then (think you) hope or truſt to be ſaved by the Law? No, he could not. But the more he looked on the Law, the more he ſaw his own damnation ſet before his eyes, as it were in a clear glaſs. So that now of himſelf he was moſt wretched and miſerable, deſtitute of all
<pb n="446" facs="tcp:54673:230"/> hope, and never able to pacifie Gods heavy diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, nor yet to eſcape the terrible judgment of God, whereunto he and all his Poſterity were fallen, by diſobeying the ſtrait Commandment of the Lord their God. <hi>But O the abundant riches of Gods great mercy!</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Rom. 11.</note> 
                     <hi>O the unſpeakable goodneſs of his heavenly Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom! When all hope of righteouſneſs was paſt on our part, when we had nothing in our ſelves, whereby we might quench his burning wrath, and work the ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of our own Souls, and riſe out of the miſerable eſtate wherein we lay: Then, even then did Chriſt the Son of God, by the appointment of his Father, come down from Heaven, to be wounded for our ſakes, to be reputed with the wicked, to be condemned unto death, to take upon him the reward of our ſins, and to give his Body to be broken on the Croſs for our offences. He</hi> (ſaith the Prophet <hi>Eſay,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Eſay 55.</note> meaning Chriſt) <hi>hath born our infirmities, and hath carried our ſorrows, the cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtiſements of our peace was upon him, and by his ſtripes we were made whole.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">2 Cor. 5.</note> St. <hi>Paul</hi> likewiſe ſaith, <hi>God made him a ſacrifice for our ſins, which knew not ſin, that we ſhould be made the righteouſneſs of God by him.</hi> And St. <hi>Peter</hi> moſt agreeably writing in this behalf, ſaith, <hi>Chriſt hath once died and ſuffered for our ſins, the juſt for the unjuſt,</hi> &amp;c. To theſe might be added an infinite number of other places to the ſame ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect: but theſe few ſhall be ſufficient for this time.</p>
                  <p>Now then (as it was ſaid in the beginning) let us ponder and weigh the cauſe of his death, that thereby we may be the more moved to glorifie him in our whole life. Which if you will have compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended briefly in one word, it was nothing elſe on our part but only the tranſgreſſion and ſin of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind. When the Angel came to warn <hi>Joſeph</hi> that he ſhould not fear to take <hi>Mary</hi> to his Wife: Did he not therefore will the Childs Name to be called <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus,</hi> becauſe he ſhould ſave his People from their ſins? When <hi>John</hi> the Baptiſt preached Chriſt, and ſhewed him to the People with his finger: Did he not plainly ſay unto them,<note place="margin">John 1.</note> 
                     <hi>Behold the Lamb of God
<pb n="447" facs="tcp:54673:230"/> which taketh away the ſins of the World?</hi> When the Woman of <hi>Canaan</hi> beſought Chriſt to help her Daughter, which was poſſeſt with a Devil:<note place="margin">Mat. 15.</note> Did he not openly confeſs, <hi>that he was ſent to ſave the loſt ſheep of the houſe of</hi> Iſrael, <hi>by giving his life for their ſins?</hi> It was ſin then, O man, even thy ſin that cauſed Chriſt the only Son of God to be crucified in the fleſh, and to ſuffer the moſt vile and ſlanderous death of the Croſs. If thou hadſt kept thy ſelf up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right, if thou hadſt obſerved the Commandments, if thou hadſt not preſumed to tranſgreſs the will of God in thy firſt Father <hi>Adam,</hi> then Chriſt,<note place="margin">Rom. 5.</note> being in form of God, needed not to have taken upon him the ſhape of a Servant: being immortal in Heaven, he needed not to become mortal on Earth: being the true Bread of the Soul, he needed not to hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger: being the healthful Water of Life, he needed not to thirſt: being life it ſelf, he needed not to have ſuffered death. But to theſe and many other ſuch extremities, was he driven by thy ſin, which was ſo manifold and great, that God could be only pleaſed in him, and none other. Canſt thou think of this, O ſinful man, and not tremble within thy ſelf? Canſt thou hear it quietly without remorſe of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, and ſorrow of Heart?

Shall man ſhew himſelf to be more hard hearted than ſtones, to have leſs compaſſion than dead Bodies? Call to mind, O ſinful Creature, and ſet before thine eyes Chriſt crucified. Think thou ſeeſt his Body ſtretched out in length upon the Croſs, his Head crowned with ſharp Thorns, and his Hands and his Feet pierced
<pb n="448" facs="tcp:54673:231"/> with Nails, his Heart opened with a long Spear, his Fleſh rent and torn with Whips, his Brows ſweating Water and Blood. Think thou heareſt him now crying in an intolerable agony to his Father, and ſaying, <hi>My God, my God, why haſt thou forſaken me?</hi> Couldſt thou behold this woful ſight, or hear this mournful voice, without Tears, conſidering that he ſuffered all this, not for any deſert of his own, but only for the grievouſneſs of thy ſins? O that mankind ſhould put the everlaſting Son of God to ſuch pains! O that we ſhould be the occaſion of his death, and the only cauſe of his condemnation! May we not juſtly cry, wo worth the time that ever we ſinned? O my Brethren, let this Image of Chriſt crucified, be always printed in our hearts, let it ſtir us up to the hatred of ſin, and provoke our minds to the earneſt love of Almighty God.

This one ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample which we have now in hand, is of more force, and ought more to move us, than all the reſt. <hi>Chriſt being the Son of God, and perfect God himſelf, who never committed ſin, was compelled to come down from Heaven, to give his Body to be bruiſed and broken on the Croſs for our ſins.</hi> Was not this a manifeſt token of Gods great wrath and diſpleaſure towards ſin, that he could be pacified by no other means, but only by the ſweet and precious Blood of his dear Son? O ſin, ſin, that ever thou ſhouldeſt drive Chriſt to ſuch extremity! Wo worth the time that ever thou cameſt into the World. But what booteth it now to bewail? Sin is come, and ſo come that it cannot be avoided. <hi>There is no man living,</hi>

                     <hi>no not the juſteſt man on the Earth but he falleth ſeven times a day,</hi> as <hi>Solomon</hi> ſaith. And our Saviour Chriſt, although he hath delivered us from ſin, yet not ſo, that we ſhall be free from committing ſin; but ſo, that it ſhall not be imputed to our condemnation. <hi>He hath taken upon him the juſt reward of ſin,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Rom. 6.</note> 
                     <hi>which was death, and by death hath overthrown death; that we believing in him, might live for ever and not die.</hi> Ought not this to engender extream hatred of ſin in us, to conſider that it did violently, as it were, pluck God out of Heaven, to make him feel the hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors and pains of Death? O that we would ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times conſider this in the midſt of our pomps and pleaſures: it would bridle the outragiouſneſs of the fleſh, it would abate and aſſwage our carnal affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, it would reſtrain our fleſhly appetites, that we ſhould not run at random, as we commonly do. To commit ſin wilfully and deſperately, without fear of God, is nothing elſe but to crucifie Chriſt anew, as we are expreſly taught in the Epiſtle to the <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brews.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Heb. 6.</note> Which thing if it were deeply printed in all mens hearts, then ſhould not ſin reign every where ſo much as it doth, to the great grief and torment of Chriſt now ſitting in Heaven.</p>
                  <pb n="450" facs="tcp:54673:232"/>
                  <p>Let us therefore remember, and always bear in mind Chriſt crucified, that thereby we may be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly moved both to abhor ſin throughly, and alſo with an earneſt and zealous heart to love God. For this is another fruit which the memorial of Chriſts death ought to work in us, an earneſt and unfeigned love towards God. <hi>So God loved the World</hi> (ſaith St. <hi>John) that he gave his only begotten Son,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">John 3.</note> 
                     <hi>that whoſoever believeth in him, ſhould not periſh, but have life everlaſting.</hi> If God declared ſo great love to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards us his ſilly Creatures, how can we of right but love him again? Was not this a ſure Pledge of his Love, to give us his own Son from Heaven? He might have given us an Angel if he would, or ſome other Creature, and yet ſhould his love have been far above our deſerts. Now, he gave us not an An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel, but his Son. And what Son? His only Son, his natural Son, his well-beloved Son, even that Son whom he had made Lord and Ruler of all things. Was not this a ſingular token of great love? But to whom did he give him? He gave him to the whole World; that it to ſay, to <hi>Adam,</hi> and all that ſhould come after him. O Lord, what had <hi>Adam,</hi> or any other man deſerved at Gods hands, that he ſhould give us his own Son? We are all miſerable Perſons, ſinful Perſons, damnable Perſons, juſtly driven out of Paradiſe, juſtly excluded from Heaven, juſtly condemned to Hell-fire: And yet (ſee a wonderful token of Gods love) he gave us his only begotten Son; us, I ſay, that were his extream and deadly Enemies, that we by vertue of his Blood ſhed upon the Croſs, might be clean purged from our ſins, and made righteous again in his ſight. Who can chuſe but marvel, to hear that God ſhould ſhew ſuch unſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able love towards us, that were his deadly Enemies? Indeed, O mortal man, thou oughteſt of right to marvel at it, and to acknowledge therein Gods great goodneſs and mercy towards mankind, which is ſo wonderful, that no fleſh, be it never ſo worldly wiſe, may well conceive it, or expreſs it. For as St. <hi>Paul</hi>
                     <pb n="451" facs="tcp:54673:232"/> teſtifieth,<note place="margin">Rom. 5.</note> 
                     <hi>God greatly commendeth and ſetteth out his love towards us, in that he ſent his Son Chriſt to die for us, when we were yet ſinners, and open enemies of his Name.</hi> If we had in any manner of wiſe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved it at his hands, then had it been no marvel at all; but there was no deſert on our part wherfore he ſhould do it. Therefore thou ſinful Creature, when thou heareſt that God gave his Son to die for the ſins of the World, think not he did it for any deſert or goodneſs that was in thee, for thou waſt then the Bond-ſlave of the Devil: But fall down upon thy knees, and cry with the Prophet <hi>David,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Pſal. 8.</note> 
                     <hi>O Lord, what is man, that thou art ſo mindful of him? or the ſon of man, that thou ſo regardeſt him?</hi> And ſeeing he hath ſo greatly loved thee, endeavour thy ſelf to love him again, with all thy Heart, with all thy Soul, and with all thy Strength, that therein thou maiſt appear not to be unworthy of his love. I report me to thine own Conſcience, whether thou wouldeſt not think thy love ill beſtowed upon him, that could not find in his heart to love thee again? If this be true, (as it is moſt true) then think how greatly it behoveth thee in Duty to love God, which hath ſo greatly loved thee, that he hath not ſpared his own only Son from ſo cruel and ſhameful a death for thy ſake. And hitherto concerning the cauſe of Chriſts Death and Paſſion, which as it was on our part moſt horrible and grievous ſin, ſo on the other ſide it was the free gift of God, proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of his meer and tender love towards mankind, without any merit or deſert of our part. The Lord for his mercies ſake grant that we never forget this great benefit of our Salvation in Chriſt Jeſu, but that we always ſhew our ſelves thankful for it, ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horring all kind of wickedneſs and ſin, and apply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing our minds wholly to the ſervice of God, and the diligent keeping of his Commandments.</p>
                  <p>Now it remaineth that I ſhew unto you, how to apply Chriſts death and Paſſion to our comfort, as a Medicine to our Wounds, ſo that it may work
<pb n="452" facs="tcp:54673:233"/> the ſame effect in us wherefore it was given; name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, the health and ſalvation of our ſouls. For as it profiteth a man nothing to have ſalve, unleſs it be well applied to the part infected: So the death of Chriſt ſhall ſtand us in no force, unleſs we apply it to our ſelves in ſuch ſort as God hath appointed. Almighty God commonly worketh by means, and in this thing he hath alſo ordained a certain mean, whereby we may take fruit and profit to our ſouls health.</p>
                  <p>What mean is that? forſooth it is Faith. Not an unconſtant and wavering Faith; but a ſure, ſtedfaſt, grounded, and unfeigned Faith. <hi>God ſent his Son into the World</hi> (ſaith St. <hi>John.</hi>

<pb n="453" facs="tcp:54673:233"/> his favour, that he hath releaſed us from the bonds of damnation, and received us again into the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of his elect People, not for our merits or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerts, but only and ſolely for the merits of Chriſts Death and Paſſion, who became man for our ſakes, and humbled himſelf to ſuſtain the reproach of the Croſs, that we thereby might be ſaved, and made inheritors of the Kingdom of Heaven. This Faith is required at our hands. And this if we keep ſted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faſtly at our hearts, there is no doubt, but we ſhall obtain Salvation at Gods hands, as did <hi>Abraham, Iſaac,</hi> and <hi>Jacob,</hi> of whom the Scripture ſaith,<note place="margin">Gen. 15. Rom. 7.</note> 
                     <hi>that they believed, and it was imputed unto them for righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs.</hi> Was it imputed unto them only? and ſhall it not be imputed unto us alſo? Yes, if we have the ſame Faith as they had, it ſhall be as truly imputed unto us for righteouſneſs, as it was unto them. For it is one Faith that muſt ſave both us and them, even a ſure and ſtedfaſt Faith in Chriſt Jeſus; who, as ye have heard, came into the World for this end, <hi>that whoſoever believe in him, ſhould not periſh,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">John 3.</note> 
                     <hi>but have life everlaſting.</hi> But here we muſt take heed that we do not halt with God through an unconſtant and wavering Faith, but that it be ſtrong and ſted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faſt to our lives end. <hi>He that wavereth</hi> (ſaith St. <hi>James) is like a wave of the Sea;</hi>
                     <note place="margin">James 1.</note> 
                     <hi>neither let that man think that he ſhall obtain any thing at Gods hands. Peter</hi> coming to Chriſt upon the Water,<note place="margin">Mat. 14.</note> becauſe he fainted in Faith, was in danger of drown<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. So we, if we begin to waver or doubt, it is to be feared leſt we ſhall ſink as <hi>Peter</hi> did: not into the Water, but into the bottomleſs Pit of Hell-fire. Therefore I ſay unto you, that we muſt apprehend the Merits of Chriſts death and Paſſion by Faith, and that with a ſtrong and ſtedfaſt Faith, nothing doubting, but that Chriſt by his own Oblation, and once offering of himſelf upon the Croſs, hath taken away our ſins, and hath reſtored us again into Gods favour, ſo fully and perfectly, that no other ſacrifice for ſin, ſhall hereafter be requiſite or needful in all the World.</p>
                  <pb n="454" facs="tcp:54673:234"/>
                  <p>Thus have you heard in few words, the mean whereby we muſt apply the fruits and merits of Chriſts death unto us, ſo that it may work the Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of our Souls: namely, a ſure, ſtedfaſt, perfect, and grounded Faith.<note place="margin">Numb. 21. John 3.</note> For as all they which beheld ſtedfaſtly the Braſen Serpent, were healed and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered at the very ſight thereof, from their corporal diſeaſes and bodily ſtings: even ſo all they which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold Chriſt crucified with a true and lively Faith, ſhall undoubtedly be delivered from the grievous wounds of the Soul, be they never ſo deadly or ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny in number. Therefore (dearly beloved) if we chance at any time through frailty of the fleſh, to fall into ſin (as it cannot be choſen, but we muſt needs fall often) and if we feel the heavy burden thereof to preſs our ſouls, tormenting us with the fear of Death, Hell, and Damnation; let us then uſe that mean which God hath appointed in his Word, to wit, the mean of Faith, which is the only inſtrument of Salvation now left unto us. Let us ſtedfaſtly behold Chriſt crucified, with the eyes of our heart. Let us only truſt to be ſaved by his Death and Paſſion, and to have our ſins clean waſhed away through his moſt precious Blood, that in the end of the World, when he ſhall come again to judge both the quick and the dead, he may receive us into his Heavenly Kingdom, and place us in the number of his Elect and choſen People, there to be partakers of that immortal and everlaſting life, which he hath purchaſed unto us by vertue of his bloody Wounds: To him therefore, with the Father, and the Holy Ghoſt, be all Honour and Glory, World without end. <hi>Amen.</hi>

                  <p>IF ever at any time the greatneſs or excellency of any matter Spiritual or Temporal, hath ſtirred up your minds to give diligent ear (good Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian People, and well-beloved in our Lord and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour Jeſus Chriſt) I doubt not but that I ſhall have you now at this preſent ſeaſon, moſt diligent and ready Hearers of the matter which I have at this time to open unto you. For I come to declare that great and moſt comfortable Article of our Chriſtian Religion and Faith, the Reſurrection of our Lord Jeſus. So great ſurely is the matter of this Article, and of ſo great weight and importance, that it was thought worthy to keep our ſaid Saviour ſtill on Earth forty days after he was riſen from death to life, to the confirmation and eſtabliſhment thereof in the hearts of his Diſciples. So that (as <hi>Luke</hi> clearly teſtifieth in the firſt Chapter of the <hi>Acts</hi> of the Apoſtles) <hi>he was converſant with his Diſciples by
<pb n="456" facs="tcp:54673:235"/> the ſpace of forty days continually together,</hi> to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent he would in his perſon, being now glorified, teach and inſtruct them, which ſhould be the teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of other, fully and in moſt abſolute and perfect-wiſe the truth of this moſt Chriſtian Article, which is the ground and foundation of our whole Religion, before he would aſcend up to his Father into the Heavens, there to receive the glory of his moſt triumphant Conqueſt and Victory. Aſſuredly, ſo highly comfortable is this Article to our Conſciences, that it is even the very Lock and Key of all our Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Religion and Faith.<note place="margin">1 Cor. 15.</note> 
                     <hi>If it were not true</hi> (ſaith the Holy Apoſtle <hi>Paul) that Chriſt roſe again, then our Preaching were in vain, your Faith which you have received, were but void, ye were yet in the danger of your ſins.

But now he is riſen again from death</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle <hi>Paul) to be the firſt-fruits of them that be aſleep, to the intent to raiſe them to everlaſting life again:</hi> Yea, if it were not true that Chriſt is riſen again, then were it neither true that he is aſcended up to Heaven, nor that he ſent down from Heaven unto us the Holy Ghoſt, nor that he ſitteth on the right hand of his Heavenly Father, having the Rule of Heaven and Earth,<note place="margin">Pſal. 17.</note>

That theſe Links therefore of our Faith ſhould all hang together in ſtedfaſt eſtabliſhment and confirmation, it pleaſed our Saviour not ſtraitway to withdraw himſelf from the bodily preſence and ſight of his Diſciples, but he choſe out forty days, wherein he would declare unto them, by manifold and moſt ſtrong arguments and tokens, that he had conquered
<pb n="457" facs="tcp:54673:235" rendition="simple:additions"/> Death, and that he was alſo truly riſen again to life. <hi>He began</hi> (ſaith <hi>Luke) at</hi> Moſes <hi>and all the Prophets,</hi>

Thus is Death ſwallowed up by Chriſts Victory, thus is Hell ſpoiled for ever. If any man doubt of this Victory, let Chriſts glorious Reſurrection declare him the thing. If Death could not keep Chriſt under his dominion and power, but that he roſe again, it is manifeſt that his power was overcome. If Death be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quered, then muſt it follow that ſin, wherefore death was appointed as the wages, muſt be alſo de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed. If Death and Sin be vaniſhed away, then is the Devil's Tyranny vaniſhed, which had the power of Death, and was the author and brewer of ſin, and the ruler of Hell.

                  <p>This mighty Conqueſt of his Reſurrection, was not only ſignified before by divers figures of the Old Teſtament, as by <hi>Samſon</hi> when he ſlew the Lion, out of whoſe mouth came ſweetneſs and honey; and as <hi>David</hi> bare his figure when he delivered the Lamb out of the Lions mouth,<note place="margin">1 Reg. 17.</note> and when he over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came and ſlew the great Giant <hi>Goliath;</hi> and as when <hi>Jonas</hi> was ſwallowed up in the Whales mouth,<note place="margin">Jonas 1.</note> and caſt up again on land alive: but was alſo moſt clearly propheſied by the Prophets of the Old Teſtament, and in the New alſo confirmed by the Apoſtles. <hi>He hath ſpoiled,</hi> ſaith St. <hi>Paul, Rule and Power,</hi>

                     <hi>and all the Dominion of our ſpiritual enemies. He hath made a ſhew of them openly, and hath triumphed over them in his own perſon.</hi> This is the mighty power of the Lord, whom we believe on. By his Death hath he wrought for us this Victory, and by his Reſurrection hath he purchaſed Everlaſting Life and Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs for us. It had not been enough to be delivered by his Death from ſin, except by his Reſurrection we had been endowed with righteouſneſs. And it ſhould not avail us to be delivered from death, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept he had riſen again, to open for us the Gates of Heaven, to enter into life everlaſting.

He paſſed through Death and Hell, to the intent to put us in good hope, that by his ſtrength we ſhall do the ſame. He paid the Ranſom of ſin, that it ſhould not be laid to our charge. He deſtroyed the Devil and all his Tyranny, and openly triumphed over

Endeavour your ſelves that way to riſe up again, which way ye fell into the Well or Pit of ſin.

Let us in like manner paſs over the affections of our old converſation, that we may be delivered from the bondage thereof,<note place="margin">Exod. 7.</note> and riſe with Chriſt. The Jews kept their Feaſt in abſtaining from leavened bread, by the ſpace of ſeven days. Let us Chriſtian folk keep our Holy-day in ſpiritual manner; that is, in abſtaining, not from material leavened bread, but from the old leaven of ſin, the leaven of maliciouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and wickedneſs. Let us caſt from us the leaven of corrupt Doctrine, that will infect our Souls. Let us keep our Feaſt the whole term of our life, with eating the bread of pureneſs of godly life, and truth of Chriſts Doctrine. Thus ſhall we declare that Chriſts gifts and graces have their effect in us, and that we have the right belief and knowledge of his holy Reſurrection: where truly, if we apply our Faith to the vertue thereof in our life, and conform us to the example and ſignification meant thereby, we ſhall be ſure to riſe hereafter to everlaſting glory, by the goodneſs and mercy of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt: To whom with the Father and the Holy Ghoſt, be all Glory, Thankſgiving, and Praiſe, <hi>in infinita ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lorum ſecula.</hi> Amen.</p>

                     <p>THE great love of our Saviour Chriſt to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards mankind (good Chriſtian People) doth not only appear in that dear-bought benefit of our Redemption and Salvation by his Death and Paſſion, but alſo in that he ſo kindly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided, that the ſame moſt merciful work might be had in continual remembrance, to take ſome place in us, and not be fruſtrate of his end and purpoſe. For as tender Parents are not content to procure for their Children coſtly Poſſeſſions and Livelihood, but take order that the ſame may be conſerved and come to their uſe: So our Lord and Saviour thought it not ſufficient to purchaſe for us his Fathers favour again (which is that deep Fountain of all goodneſs and eternal life) but alſo invented the ways moſt wiſely, whereby they might redound to our commodity and profit. Amongſt the which means, is the publick celebration of the memory of his precious Death, at the Lords Table. Which although it ſeem of ſmall vertue to ſome, yet being righly done by the Faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful,
<pb n="468" facs="tcp:54673:241" rendition="simple:additions"/> it doth not only help their weakneſs (who by their poiſoned Nature readier to remember injuries than benefits) but ſtrengtheneth and comforteth their inward man with peace and gladneſs, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth them thankful to their Redeemer, with diligent care and godly converſation.<note place="margin">Exod. 12.</note> And as of old time God decreed his wondrous benefits of the delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of his People, to be kept in memory by the eating of the Paſſover, with his Rites and Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies: So our loving Saviour hath ordained and eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed the remembrance of his great mercy expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed in his Paſſion, in the inſtitution of his Heavenly Supper,<note place="margin">Mat. 26. 1 Cor. 11.</note> where every one of us muſt be Gueſts and not Gazers, Eaters and not Lookers, feeding our ſelves, and not hiring others to feed for us; that we may live by our own meat,<note place="margin">Luke 11.</note> and not to periſh for hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, whiles other devour all.

                        <hi>and ſo let him eat of that bread, and drink of that cup:</hi> we muſt certainly know, that three things be requiſite in him which would ſeemly, as becometh ſuch high Myſteries, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſort to the Lords Table. That is, Firſt, a right and worthy eſtimation and underſtanding of this My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery. Secondly, to come in a ſure Faith. And
<pb n="469" facs="tcp:54673:241" rendition="simple:additions"/> Thirdly, to have newneſs or pureneſs of life to ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed the receiving of the ſame.</p>
                     <p>But before all other things, this we muſt be ſure of eſpecially, that this Supper be in ſuch wiſe done and miniſtred, as our Lord and Saviour did, and commanded to be done, as his holy Apoſtles uſed it, and the good Fathers in the Primitive Church fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quented it. For (as that worthy man St. <hi>Ambroſe</hi> ſaith) he is unworthy of the Lord, that otherwiſe doth celebrate that Myſtery, than it was delivered by him. Neither can he be devout, that otherwiſe doth preſume than it was given by the Author. We muſt then take heed, leſt of the Memory, it be made a Sacrifice; leſt of a Communion, it be made a pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate eating; leſt of two parts, we have but one; leſt applying it for the dead, we loſe the fruit that be alive. Let us rather in theſe matters follow the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of <hi>Cyprian</hi> in the like caſes; that is, cleave faſt to the firſt beginning, hold faſt the Lords tradition, do that in the Lords commemoration which he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf did, he himſelf commanded, and his Apoſtles confirmed. This caution or fore-ſight if we uſe, then may we ſee thoſe things that be requiſite in the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy receiver, whereof this was the firſt, that we have a right underſtanding of the thing it ſelf. As con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning which thing, this we may aſſuredly perſwade our ſelves, that the ignorant man can neither wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thily eſteem, nor effectually uſe thoſe marvellous graces and benefits offered and exhibited in that Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per: but either will lightly regard them, to no ſmall offence, or utterly condemn them, to his utter de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction. So that by his negligence he deſerveth the Plagues of God to fall upon him, and by contempt he deſerveth everlaſting Perdition. To avoid then theſe harms, uſe the advice of the Wiſe man,<note place="margin">Prov. 23.</note> who willeth thee when thou ſitteſt at an earthly Kings Table, to take diligent heed what things are ſet before thee. So now much more at the King of Kings Table, thou muſt carefully ſearch and know what dainties are provided for thy Soul, whither thou art come,
<pb n="470" facs="tcp:54673:242" rendition="simple:additions"/> not to feed thy ſenſes and belly to corruption, but thy inward man to immortality and life, nor to conſider the earthly creatures which thou ſeeſt, but the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly graces which thy Faith beholdeth. For this Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble is not (ſaith <hi>Chryſoſtom</hi>) for chattering Jays, but for Eagles, who flie thither where the dead body lieth. And if this advertiſement of man cannot perſwade us to reſort to the Lords Table with underſtanding, ſee the counſel of God in the like matter, who charged his People to teach their Poſterity, not only the Rites and Ceremonies of the Paſſover, but the cauſe and end thereof: Whence we may learn, that both more perfect knowledge is required at this time at our hands, and that the ignorant cannot with fruit and profit, exerciſe himſelf in the Lords Sacraments.</p>
                     <p>But to come nigher to the matter: St. <hi>Paul</hi> bla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming the <hi>Corinthians</hi> for the profaning of the Lords Supper, concludeth that ignorance both of the thing it ſelf, and the ſignification thereof, was the cauſe of their abuſe: <hi>for they came thither unreverently, not diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Lords Body.</hi> Ought not we then by the motion of the Wiſe man, by the wiſdom of God, by the fearful example of the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> to take advi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed heed, that we thruſt not our ſelves to this Table with rude and unreverent ignorance the ſmart where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of Chriſts Church hath rued and lamented theſe ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny days and years? For what hath been the cauſe of the ruin of Gods Religion, but the ignorance hereof? What hath been the cauſe of this groſs Idolatry, but the ignorance hereof? What hath been the cauſe of this mummiſh Maſſing, but the ignorance hereof? Yea, what hath been, and what is at this day the cauſe of this want of love and charity, but the ignorance hereof? Let us therefore ſo travel to underſtand the Lords Supper, that we be no cauſe of the decay of Gods Worſhip, of no Idolatry, of no dumb Maſſing, of no hate and malice: ſo may we the boldier have acceſs thither to our comfort.<note place="margin">Acts 1.</note> Neither, need we to think that ſuch exact knowledge is required of every man,<note place="margin">Matth. 26.</note> that he be able to diſcuſs all high points in the

All which ſayings both of the Holy Scripture and godly men, truly attributed to this celeſtial Banquet and Feaſt, if we would often call to mind, O how would they inflame our hearts to deſire the partici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pation of theſe Myſteries, and oftentimes to covet af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter this bread, continually to thirſt for this food? Not as eſpecially regarding the terrene and earthly Creatures which remain: but always holding faſt, and cleaving by Faith to the Rock whence we may ſuck the ſweetneſs of everlaſting Salvation? And to be brief, thus much more the Faithful ſee, hear, and know the favourable mercies of God ſealed, the ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction by Chriſt towards us confirmed, and the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of ſin eſtabliſhed. Here they may feel wrought the tranquillity of Conſcience, the increaſe of Faith, the ſtrengthening of Hope, the large ſpreading abroad of brotherly kindneſs, with many other ſundry graces
<pb n="472" facs="tcp:54673:243" rendition="simple:additions"/> of God. The taſte whereof they cannot attain unto, who be drowned in the deep dirty lake of blindneſs and ignorance. From the which (O beloved) waſh your ſelves with the living Waters of Gods Word, whence you may perceive and know, both the ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual food of this coſtly Supper, and the happy truſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings and effects that the ſame doth bring with it.</p>
                     <p>Now it followeth to have with this knowledge a ſure and conſtant Faith, not only that the death of Chriſt is available for the redemption of all the World, for the remiſſion of ſins, and reconciliation with God the Father: but alſo that he hath made upon his Croſs a full and ſufficient Sacrifice for thee, a perfect cleanſing of thy ſins, ſo that thou acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgeſt no other Saviour, Redeemer, Mediator, Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocate, Interceſſor, but Chriſt only, and that thou mayeſt ſay with the Apoſtle, <hi>that he loved thee, and gave himſelf for thee.</hi> For this is to ſtick faſt to Chriſts promiſe made in his Inſtitution, to make Chriſt thine own, and to apply his merits unto thy ſelf. Herein thou needeſt no other mans help, no other Sacrifice or Oblation, no ſacrificing Prieſt, no Maſs no means eſtabliſhed by mans invention. That Faith is a ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary inſtrument in all theſe holy Ceremonies, we may thus aſſure our ſelves, <hi>for that,</hi> as St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>without Faith it is unpoſſible to pleaſe God.</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Heb. 11. <hi>In Johan. Hom.</hi> 6.</note> When a great number of the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> were overthrown in the Wilderneſs, <hi>Moſes, Aaron,</hi> and <hi>Phineas</hi> did eat Manna, and pleaſed God, for that they underſtood (ſaith St. <hi>Auguſtine</hi>) the viſible meat ſpiritually. Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritually they hungred it, ſpiritually they taſted it, that they might be ſpiritually ſatisfied. And truly as the bodily meat cannot feed the outward man, unleſs it be let into the ſtomach to be digeſted, which is healthful and ſound: no more can the inward man be fed, except his meat be received into his ſoul and heart,<note place="margin">De Caena Domini.</note> ſound and whole in Faith. Therefore (ſaith <hi>Cyprian</hi>) when we do theſe things, we need not to whet our teeth: but with ſincere Faith we break and divide that whole bread. It is well known that the
<pb n="473" facs="tcp:54673:243" rendition="simple:additions"/> meat we ſeek for in this Supper, is ſpiritual food, the nouriſhment of our ſoul, a heavenly refection, and not earthly; and inviſible meat, and not bodily; a ghoſtly ſubſtance, and not carnal; ſo that to think that with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Faith we may enjoy the eating and drinking thereof, or that that is the fruition of it, is but to dream a groſs carnal feeding, baſely objecting and binding our ſelves to the Elements and Creatures. Whereas by the advice of the Council of <hi>Nicene,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Concilium Nicen.</note> we ought to lift up our minds by Faith, and leaving theſe inferiour and earthly things, there ſeek it, where the Sun of Righteouſneſs ever ſhineth. Take then this Leſſon (O thou that art deſirous of this Table) of <hi>Emiſſenus</hi> a godly Father,<note place="margin">Euſeb. Emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerem. de Euchar.</note> that when thou goeſt up to the reverend Communion to be ſatisfied with ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual meats, thou look up with Faith upon the Holy Body and Blood of thy God, thou marvel with reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, thou touch it with the mind, thou receive it with the hand of thy heart, and thou take it fully with thy inward man.</p>
                     <p>Thus we ſee (Beloved) that reſorting to this Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, we muſt pluck up all the roots of infidelity, all diſtruſt in Gods promiſes, that we make our ſelves living Members of Chriſts Body. For the unbelievers and faithleſs cannot feed upon that precious Body: whereas the faithful have their life, their abiding in him; their union, and as it were their incorporation with him. Wherefore let us prove and try our ſelves unfeigned, without flattering our ſelves, whether we be Plants of the fruitful Olive, living branches of the true Vine, Members indeed of Chriſts Myſtical Body, whether God hath purified our hearts by Faith, to the ſincere acknowledging of his Goſpel, and embracing of his mercies in Chriſt Jeſus, ſo that at this his Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble we receive not only the outward Sacrament, but the ſpiritual thing alſo: not the Figure, but the Truth: not the ſhadow only, but the body: not to death, but to life: not to deſtruction, but to ſalvation: which God grant us to do through the merits of our Lord and Saviour: To whom be all Honour and Glory for ever. <hi>Amen.</hi>

                     <p>Now followeth the third thing neceſſary in him that would not eat of this Bread, nor drink of this Cup unworthily, which is, newneſs of life, and god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs of converſation.

Yea, St. <hi>Paul</hi> teſtifieth,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 10.</note> that although the People were par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takers of the Sacraments under <hi>Moſes,</hi> yet for that ſome of them were ſtill Worſhippers of Images, Whoremongers, Tempters of Chriſt, Murmurers, and coveting after evil things: God overthrew thoſe in the Wilderneſs, and that for our example; that is, that we Chriſtians ſhould take heed we reſort un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to our Sacraments with holineſs of life, not truſting in the outward receiving of them, and infected with corrupt and uncharitable manners. For this ſentence of God muſt always be juſtified: <hi>I will have mercy and not ſacrifice.</hi>

                        </note> Wherefore (ſaith <hi>Baſil</hi>) it behoveth him that cometh to the Body and Blood of Chriſt, in commemoration of him that died and
<pb n="475" facs="tcp:54673:244"/> roſe again; not only to be pure from all filthineſs of the Fleſh and Spirit, leſt he eat and drink his own condemnation: but alſo to ſhew out evidently, a memory of him that died and roſe again for us, in this point, that ye be mortified to Sin and the World to live now to God in Chriſt Jeſu our Lord. So then we muſt ſhew outward teſtimony, in following the ſignification of Chriſts death, amongſt the which this is not eſteemed leaſt, to render thanks to Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty God for all his benefits, briefly compriſed in the Death, Paſſion, and Reſurrection of his dearly beloved Son. The which thing, becauſe we ought chiefly at this Table to ſolemnize, the godly Fathers named it <hi>Euchariſtia,</hi> that is, Thankſgiving. As if they ſhould have ſaid, Now above all other times ye ought to laud and praiſe God. Now may you behold the matter, the cauſe, the beginning, and the end of all Thankſgiving. Now if you ſlack, ye ſhew your ſelves moſt unthankful, and that no other be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit can ever ſtir you to thank God, who ſo little regard here ſo many, ſo wonderful, and ſo profita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble benefits. Seeing then that the name and thing it ſelf doth moniſh us of thanks,<note place="margin">Heb. 13.</note> 
                        <hi>let us</hi> (as St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith) <hi>offer always to God the hoſt or ſacrifice of praiſe by Chriſt; that is, the fruit of the lips which confeſs his Name.</hi> For as <hi>David</hi> ſingeth,<note place="margin">Pſal. 50.</note> 
                        <hi>He that offereth to God thanks and praiſe, honoureth him.</hi> But how few be there of thankful Perſons, in compariſon to the unthankful?<note place="margin">Luke 17.</note> Lo ten Lepers in the Goſpel were heal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and but one only returned to give thanks for his Health. Yea, happy it were, if among ſorty Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municants we could ſee two unfeignedly give thanks. So unkind we be, ſo oblivious we be, ſo proud Beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers we be, that partly we care nor for our own commodity, partly we know not our Duty to God, and chiefly we will not confeſs all that we receive. Yea, and if we be forced by Gods power to do it: yet we handle it ſo coldly, ſo drily, that our lips praiſe him, but our hearts diſpraiſe him; our tongues bleſs him, but our life curſeth him; our words
<pb n="476" facs="tcp:54673:245"/> worſhip him, but our works diſhonour him. O let us therefore learn to give God here thanks aright, and ſo to agnize his exceeding graces poured upon us, that they being ſhut up in the Treaſure-houſe of our Heart, may in due time and ſeaſon in our life and converſation, appear to the glorifying of his Holy Name.</p>
                     <p>Furthermore, for newneſs of Life, it is to be noted that St. <hi>Paul</hi> writeth: <hi>That we being many, are one bread, and one body: For all be partakers of one bread.</hi> Declaring thereby not only our Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with Chriſt, but that Unity alſo, wherein they that eat at this Table, ſhould be knit together. For by Diſſenſion, Vain-glony, Ambition, Strife, Envying, Contempt, Hatred, or Malice, they ſhould not be diſſevered: but ſo joyned by the bond of Love, in one Myſtical Body, as the corns of that Bread in one Loaf. In reſpect of which ſtrait knot of Charity, the true Chriſtians in the Primitive Church, called this Supper, Love. As if they ſhould ſay, none ought to ſit down there that were out of love and charity, who bare grudge and vengeance in his Heart, who alſo did not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs hi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Doſt thou neither fear God, the maker of this Feaſt, nor reverence his Chriſt, the refection and meat, nor regardeſt his Spouſe his well-beloved Gueſt, nor weigheſt thine own Conſcience, which is ſometime thine inward accuſer? Wherefore (O Man) tender thine own Salvation, examine and try thy good will and love towards the Children of God, the Members of Chriſt, the Heirs of the Heavenly Heritage: yea, towards the Image of God, the excellent Creature thine own Soul. If thou have offended, now be reconciled: If thou have cauſed any to ſtumble in the way of God, now ſet them up again. If thou have diſquieted thy Brother, now pacifie him. If thou have wronged him, now relieve him. If thou have defrauded him, now reſtore to him. If thou have nouriſhed ſpite, now embrace friendſhip.

                     <p>BEfore we come to the declaration of the great and manifold gifts of the Holy Ghoſt, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with the Church of God hath been evermore repleniſhed, it ſhall firſt be needful briefly to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound unto you, whereof this Feaſt of <hi>Pentecoſt</hi> or <hi>Whitſuntide</hi> had his firſt beginning. You ſhall there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore underſtand, that the Feaſt of <hi>Pentecoſt,</hi> was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways kept the fiftieth day after <hi>Eaſter;</hi> a great and ſolemn Feaſt among the Jews, wherein they did celebrate the memorial of their deliverance out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> and alſo the memorial of the publiſhing of the Law, which was given unto them in the Mount <hi>Sinai</hi> upon that day. It was firſt ordained and commanded to be kept Holy, not by any mortal man,
<pb n="481" facs="tcp:54673:247" rendition="simple:additions"/> but by the mouth of the Lord himſelf, as we read in <hi>Levit.</hi> 23. and <hi>Deut.</hi> 16. The place appointed for the obſervation thereof, was <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> where was great recourſe of People from all parts of the World; as may well appear in the ſecond Chapter of the <hi>Acts,</hi> wherein mention is made of <hi>Parthians, Medes, Ela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mites,</hi> Inhabiters of <hi>Meſopotamia,</hi> Inhabiters of <hi>Jury, Cappadocia, Pontus, Aſia, Phrygia, Pamphilia,</hi> and divers other ſuch places, whereby we may alſo partly gather, what great and Royal Solemnity was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly uſed in that Feaſt. Now as this was given in commandment to the Jews in the Old Law, ſo did our Saviour Chriſt, as it were, confirm the ſame in the time of the Goſpel,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 10.</note> ordaining (after a ſort) a new <hi>Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tecoſt</hi> for his Diſciples; namely, When he ſent down the Holy Ghoſt viſibly, in form of cloven Tongues like Fire, and gave them power to ſpeak in ſuch ſort that every one might hear them, and alſo underſtand them in his own Language. Which Miracle, that it might be had in perpetual remembrance, the Church hath thought good to ſolemnize and keep holy this day, commonly called <hi>Whitſunday.</hi> And here is to be noted, that as the Law was given to the Jews in the Mount <hi>Sinai,</hi> the fiftieth day after <hi>Eaſter,</hi> ſo was the Preaching of the Goſpel, through the mighty power of the Holy Ghoſt, given to the Apoſtles in the Mount <hi>Sion</hi> the fiftieth day after <hi>Eaſter.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And hereof this Feaſt hath his name, to be called <hi>Pentecoſt,</hi> even of the number of the days. For as (St. <hi>Luke</hi> writeth in the <hi>Acts</hi> of the Apoſtles) when fifty days were come to an end, the Diſciples being all together with one accord in one place, the Holy Ghoſt came ſuddenly among them, and ſat upon each of them, like as it had been cloven Tongues of Fire. Which thing was undoubtedly done, to teach the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles and all other Men, that it is he which giveth eloquence and utterance in Preaching the Goſpel; that it is he which openeth the mouth to declare the migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Works of God; that it is he which engendreth a
<pb n="482" facs="tcp:54673:248" rendition="simple:additions"/> burning zeal towards Gods Word, and giveth all Men a Tongue, yea, a fiery Tongue; ſo that they may boldly and chearfully profeſs the truth in the Face of the whole World, as <hi>Iſaiah</hi> was endued with this Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit.<note place="margin">Eſay. 50.</note> 
                        <hi>The Lord</hi> (ſaith <hi>Iſaiah) give me a learned and a skilful Tongue, ſo that I might know to raiſe up them that are fallen with the Word.</hi> The Prophet <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> crieth to have this gift,<note place="margin">Pſal. 50.</note> ſaying, <hi>Open thou my lips, O Lord, and my mouth ſhall ſhew forth thy praiſe.</hi> For our Saviour Chriſt alſo in the Goſpel ſaith to his Diſciples,<note place="margin">Mat. 10.</note> 
                        <hi>It is not you that ſpeak, but the Spirit of your Father which is within you.</hi> All which teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies of Holy Scripture, do ſufficiently declare that the Myſtery in the Tongues betokeneth the Preaching of the Goſpel, and the open confeſſion of the Chriſtian Faith, in all them that are poſſeſſed with the Holy Ghoſt. So that if any Man be a dumb Chriſtian, not profeſſing his Faith openly, but cloaking and colouring himſelf for fear of danger in time to come, he giveth Men occaſion, juſtly, and with good Conſcience, to doubt leſt he have not the Grace of the Holy Ghoſt within him, becauſe he is Tongue-tied, and doth not ſpeak. Thus then have ye heard the firſt inſtitution of this Feaſt of <hi>Pentecoſt</hi> or <hi>Whitſuntide,</hi> as well in the Old Law among the Jews, as alſo in the time of the Goſpel among the Chriſtians.</p>
                     <p>Now let us conſider what the Holy Ghoſt is, and how conſequently he worketh his miraculous Works towards Mankind. The Holy Ghoſt is a ſpiritual and divine Subſtance, the third Perſon in the Deity, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct from the Father and the Son, and yet proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from them both; which thing to be true, both the Creed of <hi>Athanaſius</hi> beareth witneſs, and may be alſo eaſily proved by moſt plain Teſtimonies of Gods Holy Word.<note place="margin">Mat. 3.</note> When Chriſt was Baptized of <hi>John</hi> in the River <hi>Jordan,</hi> we read that the Holy Ghoſt came down in form of a Dove, and that the Father thundred from Heaven, ſaying, <hi>This is my dear and well beloved Son, in whom I am well pleaſed.</hi> Where
<pb n="483" facs="tcp:54673:248"/> note three divers and diſtinct Perſons, the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghoſt, which all notwithſtanding are not three Gods, but one God. Likewiſe, when Chriſt did firſt inſtitute and ordain the Sacrament of Baptiſm, he ſent his Diſciples into the whole World, willing them to Baptize all Nations,<note place="margin">Mat. 28.</note> 
                        <hi>In the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghoſt.</hi> And in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther place, he ſaith, <hi>I will pray unto my Father, and he ſhall give you another Comforter.</hi> Again,<note place="margin">John 4. John 2.</note> 
                        <hi>When the Comforter ſhall come, whom I will ſend from my Father,</hi> &amp;c. Theſe, and ſuch other places of the New Teſtament, do ſo plainly and evidently confirm the diſtinction of the Holy Ghoſt from the other Perſons in the Trinity, that no Man poſſibly can doubt there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, unleſs he will blaſpheme the everlaſting truth of Gods Word. As for his proper Nature and Subſtance, it is altogether one with God the Father, and God the Son, that is to ſay, Spiritual, Eternal, Uncreated, In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comprehenſible, Almighty; to be ſhort, he is even God and Lord everlaſting. Therefore he is called the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of the Father; therefore he is ſaid to proceed from the Father and the Son; and therefore he was equally joyned with them in the Commiſſion that the Apoſtles had to Baptize all Nations. But that this may ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear more ſenſibly to the Eyes of all Men, it ſhall be requiſite to come to the other part, namely to the wonderful and heavenly Works of the Holy Ghoſt, which plainly declare unto the World his mighty and divine Power. Firſt, It is evident that he did won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfully govern and direct the Hearts of the Patriarchs and Prophets in old time, illuminating their Minds with the knowledge of the true Meſſias, and giving them utterance to Propheſie of things that ſhould come to paſs long time after.<note place="margin">2 Pet. 1.</note> 
                        <hi>For</hi> as St. <hi>Peter</hi> witneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth, <hi>the Propheſie came not in old time by the will of Man, but the holy Men of God ſpake as they were mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved inwardly by the Holy Ghoſt.</hi> And of <hi>Zachary</hi> the high Prieſt, it is ſaid in the Goſpel,<note place="margin">Luke 1.</note> 
                        <hi>That he being full of the Holy Ghoſt, Propheſied and praiſed God.</hi> So
<pb n="484" facs="tcp:54673:249" rendition="simple:additions"/> did alſo <hi>Simeon, Anna, Mary,</hi> and divers other, to the great wonder and admiration of all Men. More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over, was not the Holy Ghoſt a mighty worker in the Conception and the Nativity of Chriſt our Saviour? St. <hi>Matthew</hi> ſaith,<note place="margin">Mat. 1.</note> that the bleſſed Virgin was found with Child of the Holy Ghoſt before <hi>Joſeph</hi> and ſhe came together. And the Angel <hi>Gabriel</hi> did expreſly tell her,<note place="margin">Luke 1.</note> that it ſhould come to paſs, ſaying, <hi>The Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ghost ſhall come upon thee, and the Power of the moſt High ſhall over-ſhadow thee.</hi> A marvellous mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter that a Woman ſhould conceive and bear a Child without the knowledge of Man! But where the Holy Ghoſt worketh, there nothing is impoſſible, as may further alſo appear by the inward Regeneration and Sanctification of Mankind. When Chriſt ſaid to <hi>Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>codemus, Unleſs a Man be born a-new, of Water and the Spirit, he cannot enter into the Kingdom of God;</hi> he was greatly amazed in his mind, and began to rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon with Chriſt, demanding <hi>how a Man might be born which was old?</hi>
                        <note place="margin">John 3.</note> 
                        <hi>Can he enter</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>into his Mothers Womb again, and ſo be born anew?</hi> Behold a lively pattern of a fleſhly and carnal Man! He had little or no intelligence of the Holy Ghoſt, and therefore he goeth bluntly to work, and asketh how this thing were poſſible to be true; whereas otherwiſe if he had known the great power of the Holy Ghoſt in this be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>half, that it is he which inwardly worketh the Rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration and New Birth of Mankind, he would never have marvelled at Chriſts words, but would rather take occaſion thereby to praiſe and glorifie God. For as there are three ſeveral and ſundry Perſons in the Deity, ſo have they three ſeveral and ſundry Offices proper unto each of them.</p>
                     <p>The Father to Create, the Son to Redeem, the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ghoſt to Sanctifie and Regenerate. Whereof the laſt, the more it is hid from our underſtanding, the more it ought to move all Men to wonder at the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret and mighty working of Gods Holy Spirit which is within us. For it is the Holy Ghoſt, and no other
<pb n="485" facs="tcp:54673:249" rendition="simple:additions"/> thing, that doth quicken the Minds of Men, ſtirring up good and godly Motions in their Hearts, which are agreeable to the Will and Commandment of God, ſuch as otherwiſe of their own crooked and perverſe Nature they ſhould never have.<note place="margin">John. 5.</note> 
                        <hi>That which is born of the Spirit, is Spirit.</hi> As who ſhould ſay, Man of his own Nature is fleſhly and carnal, corrupt and naught, ſinful and diſobedient to God, without any ſpark of goodneſs in him, without any vertuous or godly Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, only given to evil Thoughts and wicked Deeds. As for the Works of the Spirit, the Fruits of Faith, cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritable and godly Motions, if he have any at all in him, they proceed only of the Holy Ghoſt, who is the only worker of our Sanctification, and maketh us new Men in Chriſt Jeſus. Did not Gods holy Spirit miraculouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly work in the Child <hi>David,</hi> when of a poor Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herd, he became a Princely Prophet?<note place="margin">1 Sam. 17.

Such is the power of the Holy Ghoſt to Regenerate Men, and as it were to bring them forth anew, ſo that they ſhall be nothing like the Men that they were be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.

Which thing to be faithfully and truly performed, the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures do ſufficiently bear witneſs. Neither muſt we think that this Comforter was either promiſed, or elſe given only to the Apoſtles, but alſo to the Univerſal Church of Chriſt, diſperſed through the whole World.
<pb n="489" facs="tcp:54673:251"/> For unleſs the Holy Ghoſt had been always preſent, go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verning and preſerving the Church from the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, it could never have ſuſtained ſo many and great brunts of Affliction and Perſecution, with ſo little da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage and harm as it hath. And the words of Chriſt are moſt plain in this behalf, ſaying,<note place="margin">John 24. Mat. 21.</note> 
                        <hi>That the Spirit of truth ſhould abide with them for ever, that he would be with them always</hi> (he meaneth by Grace, Vertue and Power,) <hi>even to the Worlds end.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Alſo in the Prayer that he made to his Father a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle before his death, he maketh interceſſion, not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for himſelf and his Apoſtles, but indifferently for all them that ſhould believe in him through their words,<note place="margin">John 17. Rom. 8</note> that is, to wit, for his whole Church. Again, St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>If any Man have not the Spirit of Chriſt, the ſame is not his.</hi> Alſo in the words following,<note place="margin">Ibidem.</note> 
                        <hi>We have received the Spirit of Adoption, whereby we cry Abba, Father.</hi> Hereby then it is evident and plain to all Men, that the Holy Ghoſt was given, not only to the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles, but alſo to the whole Body of Chriſts Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation, although not in like form and majeſty as he came down at the Feaſt of <hi>Pentecoſt.</hi> But now herein ſtandeth the Controverſie, Whether all Men do juſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly arrogate to themſelves the Holy Ghoſt or no? The Biſhops of <hi>Rome</hi> have for along time made a ſore Challenge thereunto, reaſoning with themſelves after this ſort, <hi>The Holy Ghoſt</hi> (ſay they) <hi>was promiſed to the Church, and never forſaketh the Church. But we are the chief Heads and the principal part of the Church, therefore we have the Holy Ghoſt for ever, and whatſoever things we decree are undoubted Verities, and Oracles of the Holy Ghost.</hi> That ye may perceive the weakneſs of this Argument, it is needful to teach you. Firſt, What the true Church of Chriſt is, and then to confer the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> therewith, to diſcern how well they agree together. The true Church is an Univerſal Congregation or Fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of Gods faithful and elect People, built
<pb n="490" facs="tcp:54673:252" rendition="simple:additions"/> upon the foundation of the Apoſtles and Prophets,<note place="margin">Epheſ. 2.</note> Jeſus Chriſt himſelf being the head Corner-ſtone. And it hath always three Notes or Marks whereby it is known. Pure and Sound Doctrin, the Sacraments Miniſtred according to Chriſts holy Inſtitution, and the right uſe of Eccleſiaſtical Diſcipline. This de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription of the Church is agreeable both to the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures of God, and alſo to the Doctrin of the Ancient Fathers, ſo that none may Juſtly find fault therewith. Now if you will compare this with the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> not as it was in the beginning, but as it is at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, and hath been for the ſpace of Nine hundred Years and odd; you ſhall well perceive the ſtate there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of to be ſo far wide from the nature of the true Church, that nothing can be more. For neither are they built upon the foundation of the Apoſtles and Prophets, retaining the ſound and pure Doctrin of Chriſt Jeſu; neither yet do they order the Sacraments, or elſe the Eccleſiaſtical Keys, in ſuch ſort as he did firſt Inſtitute and Ordain them: But have ſo inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mingled their own Traditions and Inventions, by chopping and changing, by adding and plucking a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, that now they may ſeem to be converted into a new Guiſe. Chriſt commended to his Church a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament of his Body and Blood; they have changed it into a Sacrifice for the Quick and the Dead. Chriſt did Miniſter to his Apoſtles, and the Apoſtles to other Men, indifferently under both kinds: They have rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed the Lay people of the Cup, ſaying, that for them one kind is ſufficient. Chriſt Ordained no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Element to be uſed in Baptiſm, but only Water, whereunto when the Word is joyned, it is made (as St. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> ſaith) a full and perfect Sacrament.<note place="margin">Auguſtine.</note> They being wiſer in their own conceit, than Chriſt, think it is not well nor orderly done, unleſs they uſe Conjura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, unleſs they Hallow the Water, unleſs there be Oyl, Salt, Spittle, Tapers, and ſuch other dumb Ceremonies, ſerving to no uſe, contrary to the plain Rule of St. <hi>Paul,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">1 Cor. 14.</note> who willeth all things to be done in
<pb n="491" facs="tcp:54673:252"/> the Church to Edification. Chriſt Ordained the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of the Keys to Excommunicate notorious ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, and to Abſolve them which are truly Penitent: They abuſe this Power at their own pleaſure, as well in Curſing the Godly with Bell, Book, and Candle, as alſo in Abſolving the Reprobate, which are known to be unworthy of any Chriſtian Society: Whereof they that Luſt to ſee Examples, let them ſearch their Lives. To be ſhort, look what our Saviour Chriſt pronounced of the Scribes and Phariſees in the Goſpel, the ſame may be boldly and with ſafe Conſcience pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced of the Biſhops of <hi>Rome;</hi> namely, that they have forſaken, and daily do forſake the Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of God, to erect and ſet up their own Conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. Which thing being true, as all they which have any light of Gods Word muſt needs confeſs, we may well conclude according to the Rule of <hi>Auguſtin,</hi> That the Biſhops of <hi>Rome</hi> and their adherents, are not the true Church of Chriſt, much leſs then to be taken as chief Heads and Rulers of the ſame. Who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever (ſaith he) do diſſent from the Scriptures con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Head,<note place="margin">Auguſt. contra Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilian.

                        </note> although they be found in all places where the Church is appointed, yet are they not in the Church; a plain place, concluding directly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi> Where is now the Holy Ghoſt which they ſo ſtoutly claim to themſelves? Where is now the Spirit of Truth, that will not ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer them in any wiſe to err? If it be poſſible to be there, where the true Church is not, then is it at <hi>Rome;</hi> otherwiſe it is but a vain brag, and nothing elſe. St. <hi>Paul</hi> (as you have heard before) ſaith, <hi>If any man have not the Spirit of Chriſt, the ſame is not his.</hi> And by turning the words, it may be truly ſaid, <hi>If any man be not of Chriſt, the ſame hath not the Spirit.</hi> Now to diſcern who are truly his, and who not, we have this Rule given us, <hi>that his Sheep do always hear his Voice.</hi> And St. <hi>John</hi> ſaith,<note place="margin">John 10. John 8.</note> 
                        <hi>He that is of God, heareth Gods Word.</hi> Whereof it followeth, that the Popes in not hearing Chriſts voice, as they
<pb n="492" facs="tcp:54673:253" rendition="simple:additions"/> ought to do, but preferring their own decrees before the expreſs Word of God, do plainly argue to the World, that they are not of Chriſt, nor yet poſſeſſed with his Spirit. But here they all alledge for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, that there are divers neceſſary Points not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed in holy Scripture,<note place="margin">John 16.</note> which were left to the Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of the Holy Ghoſt. Who being given to the Church, according to Chriſts promiſe, hath taught many things from time to time, which the Apoſtles could not then bear. To this we may eaſily Anſwer by the plain words of Chriſt, teaching us that the proper Office of the Holy Ghoſt is, not to inſtitute and bring in new Ordinances, contrary to his Doctrin before taught; but ſhall come and declare thoſe things which he had before taught,<note place="margin">John 16.</note> ſo that it might be well and truly underſtood. When the Holy Ghoſt (ſaith he) ſhall come, he ſhall lead you into all truth. What truth doth he mean? Any other than he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf had before expreſſed in his Word?<note place="margin">John 16.</note> No. For he ſaith, He ſhall take of mine, and ſhew unto you. Again, he ſhall bring you in remembrance of all things that I have told you. It is not then the Duty and part of any Chriſtian, under pretence of the Holy Ghoſt, to bring in his own Dreams and Phantaſies into the Church; but he muſt diligently provide that his Doctrin and Decrees be agreeable to Chriſts holy Teſtament; otherwiſe in making the Holy Ghoſt the Author thereof, he doth Blaſpheme and Belie the Holy Ghoſt, to his own Condemnation.</p>
                     <p>Now to leave their Doctrin, and to come to other Points. What ſhall we think or judge of the Popes in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tolerable Pride? The Scripture ſaith, <hi>that God reſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the Proud, and ſheweth grace to the Humble.</hi> Alſo it pronouceth them bleſſed <hi>which are Poor in Spirit,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Matt. 5. Matt. 14.</note> promiſing that they which humble themſelves, ſhall be exalted. And Chriſt our Saviour willeth all his to learn of him, <hi>becauſe he is humble and meek.</hi> As for Pride, St. <hi>Gregory</hi> ſaith, it is the Root of all Miſchief. And St. <hi>Auguſtin</hi>'s judgment is this, that it maketh
<pb n="493" facs="tcp:54673:253"/> Men Devils. Can any Man then, which either hath or ſhall read the Popes Lives, juſtly ſay that they had the Holy Ghoſt within them? Firſt, as touching that they will be termed Univerſal Biſhops and Heads of all Chriſtian Churches through the World; we have the judgment of <hi>Gregory</hi> expreſly againſt them,<note place="margin">

Shall we ſay that he had Gods holy Spirit within him, and not rather the Spirit of the Devil? Such a Tyrant was Pope <hi>Paſcal</hi> the II. What ſhall we ſay of him that came into his Popedom like a Fox, that reigned like a Lion, and died like a Dog?

Shall we ſay that he had Gods holy Spirit within him, and not rather the Spirit of the Devil? Such a Tyrant was Pope <hi>Hildebrand,</hi> moſt worthy to be called a Firebrand, if we ſhall term him as he hath beſt deſerved. Many other examples might here be alledged. As of Pope <hi>Joan</hi> the Harlot, that was delivered of a Child in the High-ſtreet, go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſolemnly in Proceſſion.

But to conclude and make an end, ye ſhall briefly take this ſhort Leſſon, whereſoever ye find the Spirit of Arrogance and Pride, the Spirit of Envy,

For as the Goſpel teacheth us, The Spirit of Jeſus is a good Spirit, an holy Spirit, a ſweet Spirit, a lowly Spirit, a merciful Spirit, full of Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity and Love, full of Forgiveneſs and Pity, not ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring evil for evil, extremity for extremity, but o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vercoming evil with good, and remitting all offence oven from the heart.

What other thing deſerved this blindneſs and forgetfulneſs of them at Gods hands, but utter forſaking of him; and ſo forſaking of God, they could not but fall into ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tream Ignorance and Error? And although they much eſteemed themſelves in their Wits and Knowledge, and gloried in their Wiſdom, yet vaniſhed they away blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, in their thoughts became Fools, and periſhed in their folly.

And that the entreat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of this matter in hand may be to the glory of Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty God, Let us in one Faith and Charity call upon the Father of Mercy, from whom cometh every good gift, and every perfect gift, by the mediation of his well-beloved Son our Saviour, that we may be aſſiſted with the preſence of his Holy Spirit, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitably on both parts, to demean our ſelves in ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

We ſhall therefore lay apart to ſpeak of the profound and unſearchable Nature of Almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty God, rather acknowledging our weakneſs, than raſhly to attempt what is above all Mans capacity to compaſs. It ſhall better ſuffice us in low Humility to reverence and dread his Majeſty, which we cannot comprize, than by over-much curious ſearching to be over-charged with the Glory. We ſhall rather turn our whole Contemplation to anſwer a while his good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs towards us, wherein we ſhall be much more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitably occupied, and more may we be bold to ſearch. To conſider the great Power he is of, can but make us dread and fear.

What more can be ſaid to prove that all that is good cometh from Almighty God? Is it meet to think that all ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual goodneſs cometh from God above only; and that other good things, either of Nature or of Fortune (as we call them) cometh of any other cauſe? Doth God of his goodneſs adorn the Soul with all the Powers thereof as it is; and come the gifts of the Body (wherewith it is endued) from any other? If he doth the more, cannot he do the leſs? <hi>To juſtifie a ſinner, to new create him from a wicked Perſon to a righteous Man, is a greater Act</hi> (ſaith St. <hi>Auguſtin,) than to

                     <p>And yet it is not to be thought that God hath created all this whole Univerſal World as it is, and thus once made, hath given it up to be ruled and uſed after our own wits and device, and ſo taketh no more charge thereof. As we ſee the Shipwright, after he hath brought his Ship to a perfect end, then delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth it to the Mariners, and taketh no more care thereof; nay, (God hath not ſo created the World that he is careleſs of it; but he ſtill preſerveth it by his goodneſs, he ſtill ſtayeth it in his Creation; for elſe without his ſpecial goodneſs it could not ſtand long in this condition. And therefore St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, That he preſerveth all things,<note place="margin">Heb. 2.

He is therefore inviſible every where, and in every Creature, and filleth both Heaven and Earth with his Preſence. In the Fire to give Heat, in the Water to give Moiſture, in the Earth to give Fruit, in the Heart to give his Strength, yea, in our Bread and Drink is he to give us nouriſhment, where without him the Bread and Drink cannot give ſuſtenance, nor the Herb health, as the Wiſe Man plainly confeſſeth it, ſaying,<note place="margin">Wiſd. 16.</note>

                        <hi>It is neither the Herb nor the Plaiſter that giveth Health of themſelves, but thy Word, O Lord,</hi> (ſaith the Wiſe Man) <hi>which healeth all things.</hi> It is not therefore the power of the Croatures which

That Holy Man <hi>Job</hi> evidently ſpied the goodneſs of God in this Point, and confeſſed that if he had not a ſpecial goodneſs to the preſervation of the Earth, it could not but ſhortly be over-flowed of the Sea: How could it be that the Elements, ſo divers and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary as they be among themſelves, ſhould yet agree and abide together in a concord, without deſtruction one of another to ſerve our uſe, if it came not only of Gods goodneſs ſo to temper them?

But yet peradventure ſome will ſay that they can agree to this, That all that is good per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining to the Soul, or whatſoever is created with us in Body ſhould come from God, as from the Author of all goodneſs, and from none other. But of ſuch things as be without them both, I mean ſuch good things which we call Goods of Fortune, as Riches, Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, Promotion and Honor; ſome Men may think that they ſhould come of our induſtry and diligence, of our labor and travel, rather than ſupernaturally. Now then conſider, good People, if any Author there be of ſuch things concurrent of Mans labor and endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vor,
<pb n="507" facs="tcp:54673:260"/> were it meet to aſcribe them to any other than to God? As the Paynims, Philoſophers, and Poets did Err, which took Fortune, and made her a Goddeſs to be ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nored for ſuch things? God forbid (good Chriſtian People,) that this Imagination ſhould earneſtly be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived of us that be Worſhippers of the true God, whoſe Works and Proceedings be expreſſed manifeſtly in his Word. (Theſe be the opinions and ſayings of Infidels, not of true Chriſtians;<note place="margin">Job 22.</note> for they indeed (as <hi>Job</hi> mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth mention) believe and ſay, <hi>That God hath his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidence and reſting place in the Clouds, and conſidereth nothing of our matters.</hi> Epicures they be that ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine that he walketh about the Coaſts of the Heavens, and hath no reſpect of theſe inferior things, but that all theſe things ſhould proceed either by chance or at adventure, or elſe by diſpoſition of Fortune, and God to have no ſtroke in them. What other thing is this to ſay, than as the Fool ſuppoſeth in his heart, there is no God? whom we ſhall none otherwiſe reprove, than with Gods own Words by the mouth of <hi>David, Hear my People</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>for I am thy God,</hi>

Fortune whom they paint to be blind of both eyes, ever unſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and unconſtant in her Wheel, in whoſe hands they ſay theſe things be? Or God, in whoſe hand and power theſe things be indeed, who for his truth and conſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy was yet never reproved; for his ſight looketh through Heaven and Earth, and ſeeth all things pr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="508" facs="tcp:54673:261"/> from his knowledge, not the privy thoughts of Mens minds. Truth it is, that God is all Riches, all Power, all Authority, all Health, Wealth and Proſperity, of the which we ſhould have no part without his liberal diſtribution, and except it came from him above. <hi>David</hi> firſt teſtifieth of Riches and Poſſeſſions,<note place="margin">Pſal. 104.</note> 
                        <hi>If thou gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſt good luck they ſhall gather, and if thou openeſt thy hand they ſhall be full of goodneſs, but if thou tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt thy face they ſhall be troubled.</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Prov. 10. 1 King 2.</note> And <hi>Solomon</hi> ſaith, <hi>It is the bleſſing of the Lord that maketh rich Men.</hi> To this agreeth the Holy Woman <hi>Ann,</hi> where ſhe ſaith in her Song, <hi>It is the Lord that maketh the poor, and maketh the rich, it is he that promoteth and pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth down, he can raiſe a needy Man from his Miſery and from the Dunghil, he can lift up a poor Perſonage to ſit with Princes and have the ſeat of Glory, for all the Coaſts of the Earth be his.</hi> Now if any Man will ask, What ſhall it avail us to know that every good gift, as of Nature and Fortune (ſo called) and every perfect Gift, as of Grace, concerning the Soul, to be of God, and that it is his gift only? Forſooth, for many cauſes it is convenient for us to know it; for ſo ſhall we know (if we confeſs the truth,) who ought juſtly to be thanked for them. Our Pride ſhall be thereby abated, perceiving nought to come of our ſelves but Sin and Vice; if any goodneſs be in us, to refer all laud and praiſe for the ſame to Almighty God. It ſhall make us not advance our ſelves before our Neighbor, not deſpiſe him for that he hath fewer gifts, ſeeing God giveth his gifts where he will.

                        <hi>What haſt thou that thou haſt not received? and if thou haſt received it, why glorieſt thou in thy ſelf, as though thou hadſt
<pb n="509" facs="tcp:54673:261"/> not received it?</hi> To confeſs that all good things come from Almighty God, is a great Point of Wiſdom my Friends: For ſo confeſſing, we know whither to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſort for to have them, if we want, as St. <hi>James</hi> biddeth us, ſaying, <hi>If any Man wanteth the gift of Wiſdom,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">James 1.</note> 
                        <hi>let him ask it of God that gives it, and it ſhall be given him.</hi> As the Wiſe Man in the want of ſuch a like gift, made his recourſe to God for it, as he teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fieth in his Book:<note place="margin">Sap. 10.</note> After I knew (ſaith he) that other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe I could not be chaſt, except God granted it, (and this was as he there writeth, high wiſdom to know whoſe gift it was,) I made haſt to the Lord, &amp; earneſtly beſought him, even from the Roots of my Heart to have it. I would to God (my Friends) that in our wants and neceſſities we would go to God, as St. <hi>James</hi> biddeth, and as the Wiſe Man teacheth us that he did. I would we believed ſtedfaſtly that God only gives them; if we did, we ſhould not ſeek our want and neceſſity of the Devil and his Miniſters ſo oft as we do, as daily experience declareth it. For if we ſtand in ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity of Corporal Health, whither go the common People but to Charms, Witchcrafts, and other delu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of the Devil? If we knew that God were the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of this gift, we would only uſe his means appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and bide his leiſure till he thought it good for us to have it given: If the Merchant and Worldly Occu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pier knew that God is the giver of Riches, he would content himſelf with ſo much as by juſt means appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved of God, he could get to his Living, and would be no richer than truth would ſuffer him, he would never procure his gain, and ask his Goods at the Devils hand. Godforbid ye will ſay, that any Man ſhould take his Riches of the Devil. Verily, ſo many as increaſe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves by Uſury, by Extortion, by Perjury, by Stealth, by Deceits and Craft, they have their Goods of the Devils gift. And all they that give themſelves to ſuch means, and have renounced the true means that God hath appointed, have forſaken him, and are become Worſhippers of the Devil, to have their lucres and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages.
<pb n="510" facs="tcp:54673:262" rendition="simple:additions"/> They be ſuch as kneel down to the Devil at his bidding, and worſhip him; for he promiſeth them for ſo doing, that he will give them the World and the Goods therein. They cannot otherwiſe better ſerve the Devil than to do his Pleaſure and Commandment; and his Motion and Will it is to have us forſake the Truth, and betake us to Falſhood, to Lies and Perju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries. They therefore which believe perfectly in their heart that God is to be honored and requeſted for the gift of all things neceſſary, would uſe none other means to relieve their neceſſities but Truth and Verity, and would ſerve God to have competency of all things ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary. The Man in his need would not relieve his want by Stealth<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> The Woman would not relieve her neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and poverty by giving her Body to other in Adulte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry for gain. If God be the Author indeed of Life, Health, Riches and VVelfare, let us make our recourſe to him as the Author, and we ſhall have it, ſaith St. <hi>James.</hi> Yea, it is high wiſdom (by the Wiſe Man) therefore to know whoſe gift it is, for many other skills, it is wſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom to know and believe that all goodneſs and graces be of God, as the Author. Which thing well conſidered, muſt needs make us think that we ſhall make account for that which God giveth us to poſſeſs, and therefore ſhall make us to be more diligent well to ſpend them to Gods glory, and to the profit of our Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bor, that we may make a good account at the laſt, and be praiſed for good Stewards, that we may hear theſe words of our Judge,<note place="margin">Mat. 24.</note> 
                        <hi>Well done good ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant &amp; faithful, thou haſt been faithful in little, I will make thee Ruler over much, go into thy Maſters joy.</hi> Beſides, to believe certainly God to be the Author of all gifts that we have, ſhall make us to be in ſilence and patience when they be taken again from us. For as God of his mercy doth grant us them to uſe, ſo otherwhiles he doth juſtly take them again from us, to prove our Patience, to exerciſe our Faith, and by the means of the taking away of a few, to beſtow the more warily thoſe that remain, to teach us
<pb n="511" facs="tcp:54673:262" rendition="simple:additions"/> to uſe them the more to his Glory, after he giveth them to us again. Many there be, that with Mouth can ſay, that they believe that God is the Author of every good Gift that they have; but in the time of Temptation they go back from this Belief. They ſay it in word, but deny it in deed. Conſider the cuſtom of the World, and ſee whether it be not true. Behold the rich Man that is indued with Subſtance, if by any Adverſity his Goods be taken from him, how fumeth and fretteth he? How murmureth he and deſpaireth? He that hath the gift of good Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation, if his Name be any thing touched by the Detractor, how unquiet is he? How buſie to revenge his deſpite? If a Man hath a gift of Wiſdom, and fortune to be taken of ſome evil Willer for a Fool, and is ſo reported? How much doth it grieve him to be ſo eſteemed? Think ye that theſe believe conſtantly that God is the Author of theſe gifts? If they believe it verily, why ſhould they not patiently ſuffer God to take away his gifts again, which he gave them free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and lent for a time? But ye will ſay, I could be content to reſign to God ſuch Gifts, if he took them again from me: But now are they taken from me by evil chances and falſe ſhrews, by naughty wretches, how ſhould I take this thing patiently? To this may be anſwered, that Almighty God is of his nature in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſible, and cometh to no Man viſible after the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of Man, to take away his Gifts that he lent. But in this point whatſoever God doth, he bringeth it about by his inſtruments ordained thereto. He hath good Angels, he hath evil Angels, he hath good Men, and he hath evil Men, he hath Hail and Rain, he hath Wind and Thunder, he hath Heat and Cold. Innumerable inſtruments hath he, and meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſengers, by whom again he asketh ſuch Gifts as he committeth to our truſt, as the Wife man confeſſeth,<note place="margin">Sap. 1<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="512" facs="tcp:54673:263"/> to revenge his Enemies, and otherwhiles to the probation of our Faith, ſtirreth he up ſuch ſtorms. And therefore by what mean and inſtrument ſoever God takes from us his Gifts, we muſt patiently take Gods Judgment in worth, and acknowledge him to be the Taker and Giver,<note place="margin">Job 1.</note> as <hi>Job</hi> ſaith, <hi>The Lord gave, and the Lord took,</hi> when yet his Enemies drove his Cattle away, and when the Devil ſlew his Children, and afflicted his Body with grievous Sickneſs. Such meekneſs was in that holy King and Prophet <hi>David,</hi> when he was reviled of <hi>Shimei</hi> in the preſence of all his Hoſt, he took it patiently, and reviled not again, but as confeſſing God to be the Author of his Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency and good Name, and offering it to be at his pleaſure: Let him alone (ſaith he to one of his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants that would have revenged ſuch deſpite) for God hath commanded him to curſe <hi>David,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">2 Sam. 16.</note> and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>adventure God intendeth thereby to render me ſome good turn for this curſe of him to day. And though the Miniſter other whiles doth evil in his Act, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding of Malice, yet foraſmuch as God turneth his evil act to a proof of our Patience, we ſhould rather ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit our ſelves in Patience, than to have indignation at Gods Rod, which peradventure when he hath cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected us to our nurture, he will caſt it into the fire, as it deſerveth. Let us in like manner truly acknowledge all our Gifts and Prerogatives, to be ſo Gods Gifts, that we ſhall be ready to reſign them up at his Will and Pleaſure again. Let us throughout our whole Lives confeſs all good things to come from God, of what Name or Nature ſoever they be, not of theſe corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tible things only, whereof I have now laſt ſpoken, but much more of all Spiritual Graces behoveable for our Soul, without whoſe Goodneſs no Man is called to Faith or ſtaid therein, as I ſhall hereafter in the next part of this Homily declare to you. In the mean ſeaſon forget not what hath already been ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken to you, forget not to be conformable in your judgments to the truth of his Doctrin, and forget

                     <head>The Third Part of the Homily for Rogation-Week.</head>
                     <p>I Promiſed to you to declare, that all Spiritual Gifts and Graces come ſpecially from God. Let us conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the truth of this matter, and hear what is teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied firſt of the gift of Faith, the firſt entry into a Chriſtian Life, without which no Man can pleaſe God. For St. <hi>Paul</hi> confeſſeth it plainly to be Gods gift,<note place="margin">Epheſ. 2. 1 Pet. 1.</note> ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>Faith is the gift of God.</hi> And again, St. <hi>Peter</hi> ſaith, <hi>It is of Gods power that ye be kept through Faith to Salvation.</hi> It is of the goodneſs of God that we falter not in our hope unto him. It is verily Gods work in us, the Charity wherewith we love our Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren. If after our fall we Repent, it is by him that we Repent, which reacheth forth his Merciful Hand to raiſe us up. If we have any Will to riſe, it is he that preventeth our Will, and diſpoſeth us thereto. If after Contrition we feel our Conſciences at peace with God through remiſſion of our ſin, and ſo be reconciled again to his favor, and hope to be his Children, and Inheritors of Everlaſting Life: Who worketh theſe great Miracles in us? Our Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thineſs, our Deſervings and Endeavors, our Wits and Vertue? Nay verily, St. <hi>Paul</hi> will not ſuffer Fleſh and Clay to preſume to ſuch Arrogancy, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſaith, <hi>All is of God which hath reconciled us to himſelf by Jeſus Chriſt. For God was in Chriſt when he reconciled the World unto himſelf.</hi> God the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="514" facs="tcp:54673:264" rendition="simple:additions"/> of all Mercy, wrought this high benefit unto us, not by his own Perſon, but by a mean, by no leſs a mean than his only beloved Son, whom he ſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red not from any pain and travail that might do us good. For upon him he put our Sins, and upon him he made our Ranſom, him he made the mean be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt us and himſelf, whoſe mediation was ſo accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table to God the Father, through his abſolute and perfect Obedience, that he took his Act for a full ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction of all our Diſobedience and Rebellion, whoſe Righteouſneſs he took to weigh againſt our Sins, whoſe Redemption he would have ſtand againſt our Damnation. In this Point, what have we to muſe within our ſelves, good Friends? I think no leſs that that which St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaid in remembrance of this wonderful goodneſs of God, <hi>Thanks be to Almighty God,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Rom. 7. Epheſ. 1.</note> 
                        <hi>through Jeſus Chriſt our Lord: for it is he, for whoſe ſake we received this high gift of Grace. For as by him</hi> (being the Everlaſting Wiſdom) <hi>he wrought all the World, and that is contained therein.</hi> So by him only and wholly, would he have all things reſtored again in Heaven and Earth. By this our Heavenly Mediator, therefore do we know the Favor and Mercy of God the Father; by him know we his Will and Pleaſure towards us,<note place="margin">Matt. 3.</note> 
                        <hi>For he is the bright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of his Fathers Glory, and a very clear Image and Pattern of his Subſtance.</hi> It is he whom the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in Heaven delighteth to have for his <hi>well beloved Son,</hi> whom he Authorized to be our Teacher, whom he charged us to hear,<note place="margin">Epheſ. 1.</note> ſaying, <hi>Hear him.</hi> It is he by whom the Father of Heaven doth bleſs us with all Spiritual and Heavenly gifts, for whoſe ſake and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vor (writeth St. <hi>John</hi>) we have received Grace and Favor.<note place="margin">John 1.</note> To this our Saviour and Mediator, hath God the Father given the Power of Heaven and Earth, and the whole Juriſdiction and Authority, to deſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute his Goods and Gifts committed to him; for ſo writeth the Apoſtle,<note place="margin">Epheſ. 4.7.</note> 
                        <hi>To every one of us is Grace given, according to the meaſure of Chriſts giving.</hi> And
<pb n="515" facs="tcp:54673:264" rendition="simple:additions"/> thereupon to execute his Authority committed, after that he had brought Sin and the Devil to Captivity, to be no more hurtful to his Members, he aſcended up to his Father again, and from thence ſent liberal Gifts to his welbeloved Servants, and hath ſtill the power to the Worlds end, to diſtribute his Fathers Gifts continually in his Church, to the eſtabliſhment and comfort thereof. And by him hath Almighty God decreed to diſſolve the World, to call all before him, to judge both the Quick and the Dead, and finally by him ſhall he Condemn the Wicked to Eternal Fire in Hell, and give the Good Eternal Life, and ſet them aſſuredly in preſence with him in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven for evermore. Thus ye ſee how all is of God, by his Son Chriſt our Lord and Saviour.

This know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge and feeling is not in our ſelves, by our ſelves it is not poſſible to come by it, a great pity it were that we ſhould loſe ſo profitable knowledge. Let us therefore meekly call upon that bountiful Spirit, the Holy Ghoſt, which proceedeth from our Father of Mercy, and from our Mediator Chriſt, that he would aſſiſt us, and inſpire us with his preſence, that in him we may be able to hear the goodneſs of God declared unto us, to our Salvation.

For he is ſoon ſeen of them that love him, he will be found of them that ſeek him; for very liberal and gentle is the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of Wiſdom. In his power ſhall we have ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Abilty to know our Duty to God, in him ſhall we be comforted and encouraged to walk in our Duty; in him ſhall we be meet veſſels to receive the Grace of Almighty God; for it is he that purgeth and pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifieth the mind by his ſecret working.

To hold the way which God had prepar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for us to walk rightly in our Journey, we muſt acknowledge that it is in the power of his Spirit which helpeth our infirmity.

                        <hi>Let him that rejoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth, rejoyce in this, that he underſtandeth and knoweth me, for I am the Lord which ſheweth Mercy, Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and Righteouſneſs in the Earth, for in theſe things I delight, ſaith the Lord.</hi> This Wiſdom can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be attained, but by the direction of the Spirit of God, and therefore it is called Spiritual Wiſdom. And no where can we more certainly ſearch for the knowledge of this Will of God (by the which we muſt direct all our Works and Deeds) but in the holy Scriptures, <hi>for they be they that teſtifie of him,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">John 5.</note> ſaith our Saviour Chriſt. It may be called Knowledg and Learning, that is other where gotten without the Word; but the Wiſe Man plainly teſtifieth,<note place="margin">Wiſd. 13.</note> 
                        <hi>that they all be but Vain, which have not in them the Wiſdom of God.</hi> We ſee to what Vanity the Old Philoſophers came, who were deſtitute of this Science, gotten and ſearched for in his Word. We ſee what Vanity the School Doctrin is mixed with, for that in this Word they ſought not the Will of God, but rather the Will of Reaſon, the Trade of Cuſtom, the Path of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, the Practice of the Church; Let us therefore Read and Revolve the holy Scripture both Day and Night,<note place="margin">Pſal. 1.

                        <hi>For bleſſed is he that hath his whole medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion therein. It is that which giveth light to our Feet to walk by.</hi> It is that which giveth Wiſdom to the ſimple and ignorant. In it may we find Eternal Life.</p>
                     <p>In the holy Scriptures find we Chriſt, in Chriſt find we God; for he it is that is the expreſs Image
<pb n="518" facs="tcp:54673:266" rendition="simple:additions"/> of the Father. He that ſeeth Chriſt, ſeeth the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. And contrariwiſe, as St. <hi>Jerome</hi> ſaith, the ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance of the Scripture, is the ignorance of Chriſt. Not to know Chriſt,<note place="margin">Pſal. 19. Heb. 1. John 14.</note> is to be in darkneſs, in the midſt of our Worldly and Carnal light of Reaſon and Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophy. To be without Chriſt, is to be in fooliſhneſs: For he is the only Wiſdom of the Father, in whom it pleaſed him, that all fulneſs and perfection ſhould dwell.<note place="margin">Coloſſ. 2.</note> With whom whoſoever is endued in Heart by Faith, and rooted faſt in Charity, hath laid a ſure Foundation to build on, whereby he may be able to comprehend with all Saints, what is the breadth, length, and depth, and to know the love of Chriſt. This uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal and abſolute knowledge, is that Wiſdom which St. <hi>Paul</hi> wiſheth theſe <hi>Epheſians</hi> to have, as under Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven the greateſt treaſure that can be obtained.<note place="margin">Epheſ. 3.</note> For of this Wiſdom the Wiſe Man writeth thus of his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience; <hi>All good things came to me together with her, and innumerable Riches through her hands.</hi> And addeth more in that ſame place,<note place="margin">Sap. 7.</note> 
                        <hi>She is the Mother of all theſe things; for ſhe is an infinite treaſure unto Men, which whoſo uſe, become partakers of the love of God.</hi> I might with many words move ſome of this audience to ſearch for this Wiſdom, to ſequeſter their Reaſon, to follow Gods Commandment, to caſt from them the Wits of their Brains, to favor this Wiſdom, to renounce the Wiſdom and Policy of this fond World, to taſte and Savor of that where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto the Favor and Will of God hath called them, and willeth us finally to enjoy by his Favor, if we would give ear. But I will haſte to the Third Part of my Text, wherein is expreſſed further in Sapience, how God giveth his Elect underſtanding of the moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the Heavens, of the alteration and circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of Time. Which as it followeth in words more plentiful in the Text which I have laſt cited unto you, ſo it muſt needs follow in them that be endued with this Spiritual Wiſdom. For as they can ſearch where to find this Wiſdom, and know of whom to ask
<pb n="519" facs="tcp:54673:266"/> it: So know they again that in time it is found, and can therefore temper themſelves to the occaſion of the time, to ſuffer no time to paſs away, wherein they may labor for this Wiſdom. And to encreaſe there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, they know how God of his infinite Mercy and le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity giveth all Men here time and place of Repentance. And they ſee how the Wicked (as <hi>Job</hi> writeth) abuſe the ſame to their Pride,<note place="margin">Job. 14.</note> and therefore do the Godly take the better hold of the time, to redeem it out of ſuch uſe as it is ſpoiled in by the Wicked. They which have this Wiſdom of God, can gather by the diligent and earneſt ſtudy of the World<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings of this preſent life, how they wait their times, and apply themſelves, to every occaſion of time, and to get Riches, to encreaſe their Lands and Patrimony. They ſee the time paſs away, and therefore take hold on it, in ſuch wiſe, that otherwhiles they will with loſs of their ſleep and eaſe, with ſuffering many pains, catch the offer of their time, knowing that that which is paſt cannot be returned again; Repentance may fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, but remedy is none. Why ſhould not they then that be Spiritually Wiſe in their Generation, wait their time, to encreaſe as faſt in their ſtate, to win and gain Everlaſtingly? They reaſon what a brute forgetfulneſs it were in Man endued with Reaſon, to be ignorant of their Times and Tides, when they ſee the Turtle Dove, the Stork, and the Swallow to wait their times,<note place="margin">Jer. 8.</note> as <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remy</hi> ſaith, <hi>The Stork in the Air knoweth her appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed times, the Turtle, the Grane, and the Swallow ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve the time of their coming: but my People know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth not the judgment of the Lord.</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Epheſ. 2.</note> St. <hi>Paul</hi> willeth us <hi>to redeem the time, becauſe the days are evil.</hi> It is not the Counſel of St. <hi>Paul</hi> only, but of all other that ever gave precepts of Wiſdom.</p>
                     <p>There is no Precept more ſeriouſly given and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded, than to know the time. Yea, Chriſtian Men for that they hear how grievouſly God complain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, and threatneth in the Scriptures them which will not know the time of his Viſitations, are learned
<pb n="520" facs="tcp:54673:267"/> thereby, the rather earneſtly to apply themſelves there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto. After our Saviour Chriſt had Propheſied with weeping Tears of the deſtruction of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> at the laſt he putteth the cauſe:<note place="margin">Luke 19.</note> 
                        <hi>For that thou haſt not known the time of thy Viſitation.</hi> O <hi>England,</hi> ponder the time of Gods merciful Viſitation, which is ſhewed thee from day to day, and yet will not regard it, neither wilt thou with his Puniſhment be driven to thy Duty, nor with his benefits be provoked to Thanks!

Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, howſoever the World, in generality is for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getful of God, let us Particularly attend to our time, and win the time with diligence, and apply our ſelves to the Light and Grace that is afforded us; let us, if Gods Favor and Judgments which he worketh in our time, cannot ſtir us to call home to our ſelves to do that belonging to our Salvation, at the leaſt way, let the malice of the Devil, the naughtineſs of the World, which we ſee exerciſed in theſe perilous and laſt times, wherein we ſee our days ſo dangerouſly ſet, provoke us to watch diligently to our vocation, to walk and go forward therein.</p>
                     <p>Let the miſery and ſhort tranſitory joys ſpied in the caſualty of our days, move us while we have them in our hands, and ſeriouſly ſtir us to be wiſe, and to expend the gracious good Will of God to us ward, which all the day long ſtretched out his Hands (as the Prophet ſaith) unto us,<note place="margin">Iſaiah 65.</note> for the moſt part his mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciful Hands, ſometime his heavy Hands, that we being learned thereby, may eſcape the danger that muſt needs fall on the unjuſt, who lead their days in felicity and pleaſure, without the knowing of Gods Will toward them, but ſuddenly they go down into Hell. Let us be found Watchers, found in the Peace of the Lord, that at the laſt Day we may be found without ſpot, and blameleſs; yea, let us endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vor our ſelves (good Chriſtian People) diligently to keep the preſence of his holy Spirit.<note place="margin">Job 2.</note> Let us renounce

Let us caſt away all the whole lump of ſin that ſtandeth about us, for he will never dwell in that Body that is ſubdued to ſin. We cannot be ſeen Thankful to Almighty God, and work ſuch de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpight to the Spirit of Grace, by whom we be Sanctified.<note place="margin">Heb. 10.</note> If we do our endeavor, we ſhall not need to fear.

Therefore it cannot be but true that St. <hi>Paul</hi> affirmeth; Of him, by him, and in him be all things, and in him (after this tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitory life well paſſed) ſhall we have all things.

                        <hi>When the Son of God ſhall ſubdue all things unto him, then ſhall God be all in all.</hi> If ye will know how God ſhall be all in all, verily after this ſenſe may we underſtand it: In this World ye ſee that we be fain to borrow many things to our neceſſity, of many Creatures; there is no one thing that ſufficeth all our neceſſities. If we be an Hungred, we luſt for Bread. If we be Athirſt, we ſeek to be refreſhed with Ale or Wine. If we be Cold, we ſeek for Cloth. If we be Sick, we ſeek to the Phyſitian.

He ſhall be to us both Father and Mother, he ſhall be Bread and Drink, Cloth, Phyſician, Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort;
<pb n="522" facs="tcp:54673:268"/> he ſhall be all things to us, and that of much more bleſſed faſhion, and more ſufficient contentati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, than ever theſe Creatures were unto us, with much more declaration than ever Mans declaration, than ever Mans reaſon is able to conceive. <hi>The Eye of Man is not able to behold,</hi>

                  <p>ALthough we be now Aſſembled together (good Chriſtian People) moſt principally to laud and thank Almighty God for his great Benefits, by behold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Fields repleniſhed with all manner of Fruit, to the maintainance of our Corporal Neceſſities, for our Food and Suſtenance; and partly alſo to make our humble ſuits in Prayers to his Fatherly Providence, to conſerve the ſame Fruits in ſending us ſeaſonable Wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, whereby we may gather in the ſaid Fruits to that end, for which his Fatherly goodneſs hath provided them; yet have we occaſion ſecondarily given us in our walks on thoſe days, to conſider the old Ancient Bounds and Limits belonging to our own Townſhip, and to other our Neigbors bordering about us, to the intent that we ſhould be content with our own, and not contentiouſly ſtrive for others, to the breach of Charity, by any incroaching one upon another, for
<pb n="524" facs="tcp:54673:269"/> claiming one of the other further than that in ancient right and cuſtom, our Fore-fathers have peaceably laid out unto us for our commodity and comfort. Sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly a great overſight it were in us, which be Chriſtian Men in one profeſſion of Faith, daily looking for that Heavenly Inheritance which is bought for every one of us by the Blood-ſhedding of our Saviour Jeſus Chriſt, to ſtrive and fall to variance for the Earthly Bounds of our Towns, to the diſquiet of our Life betwixt our ſelves, to the waſting of our Goods by vain Expences and Coſts in the Law. We ought to remember that our Habitation is but tranſitory and ſhort in this mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal Life. The more ſhame it were to fall out into im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortal hatred among our ſelves, for ſo brittle Poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, and ſo to loſe our eternal Inheritance in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven. It may ſtand well with Charity for a Chriſtian Man quietly to maintain his right and juſt Title; and it is the part of every good Townſman to preſerve as much as lieth in him, the Liberties, Franchiſes, Bounds and Limits of his Town and Countrey: But yet to ſtrive for our very Rights and Duties, with the breach of Love and Charity, which is the only Livery of a Chriſtian Man, or with the hurt of godly peace and quiet, by the which we be knit together in one gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral fellowſhip of Chriſts Family, in one common Houſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold of God, that is utterly forbidden. That doth God abhor and deteſt, which provoketh Almighty Gods wrath otherwhile to deprive us quite of our Commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities and Liberties, becauſe we do ſo abuſe them for matters of Strife, Diſcord and Diſſention. St. <hi>Paul</hi> blamed the <hi>Corinthians</hi> for ſuch contentious ſuing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong themſelves, to the ſlander of their Profeſſion before the Enemies of Chriſts Religion, ſaying thus unto them,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 9.</note> Now there is utterly a fault among you, becauſe ye go to Law one with another; why rather ſuffer ye not wrong? why rather ſuffer ye not harm?

<pb n="525" facs="tcp:54673:269"/> in a Chriſtian Man:<note place="margin">Mat. 5.</note> If Chriſt our Saviour would have us rather to ſuffer wrong, and to turn our left Cheek to him which hath ſmitten the right, to ſuffer one wrong after another, rather than by breach of Chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to defend our own; in what State be they before God who do the wrong? what curſes do they fall into who by falſe witneſs defraud either their Neighbor or Townſhip of his due right and juſt poſſeſſion, which will not let to take an Oath by the holy Name of God, the Author of all Truth, to ſet out Falſhood and a Wrong? <hi>Know ye not</hi> (ſaith St. <hi>Paul,</hi>

Let us therefore take ſuch heed in maintaining of our Bounds and Poſſeſſions, that we commit not wrong by encroaching upon other; let us beware of ſudden Verdict in things of doubt; let us well adviſe our ſelves to avouch that certainly, whereof either we have no good knowledge or remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance, or to claim that we have no juſt Title to.

Is it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other thing but a token of Gods ire, revenging our Wrongs and Injuries done one to another? <hi>Ye have ſown much,</hi> (upbraideth God by his Prophet <hi>Haggai,) and yet bring in little; ye eat,</hi>

                     <hi>but ye be not ſatisfied; ye drink, but ye be not filled; ye cloath your ſelves, but ye be not warm; and he that earneth his Wages, putteth it into a bottomleſs Purſe: Ye looked for much increaſe, but loe, it came to little, and when ye brought it home (into your Barns) I did blow it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way,</hi> ſaith the Lord. O conſider therefore the Ire of God againſt Gleaners, Gatherers and Incroachers upon other Mens Lands and Poſſeſſions: It is lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table to ſee in ſome places how greedy Men uſe to Plough and grate upon their Neighbors Land that lieth next them; how covetous Men now a days Plough up ſo nigh the common Balks and Walks, which good Men before time made the greater and broader, part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for the commodious Walk of his Neighbor, partly for the better ſhack in Harveſt time, to the more com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort of his poor Neighbors Cattle. It is a ſhame to behold the inſatiableneſs of ſome covetous Perſons in their doings, that where their Anceſtors left of their Land a broad and ſufficient Bier-balk, to carry the Corps to the Chriſtian Sepulture, how Men pinch at ſuch Bier-balks, which by long uſe and cuſtom ought to be inviolably kept for that purpoſe; and now they either quite eare them up, and turn the dead Body to
<pb n="528" facs="tcp:54673:271"/> be born farther about in the High Streets, or elſe if they leave any ſuch Meer, it is too ſtraight for two to walk on.</p>
                  <p>Theſe ſtrange encroachments (good Neighbors) ſhould be looked upon; theſe ſhould be conſidered in theſe days of our Perambulations. And afterward the Parties admoniſhed and charitably reformed, who be the doers of ſuch private gaining, to the ſlander of the Townſhip and the hindrance of the Poor. Your High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways ſhould be conſidered in your Walks, to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand where to beſtow your days works according to the good Statutes provided for the ſame. It is a good deed of Mercy to amend the dangerous and noiſom Ways, whereby thy poor Neighbor ſitting on his ſilly weak Beaſt, founder not in the deep thereof, and ſo the Market the worſe ſerved for diſcouraging of the poor Victuallers, to reſort thither for the ſame cauſe.

                  <p>THe Word of Almighty God doth teſtifie and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare whence the Original Beginning of Matri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony cometh, and why it is ordained. It is inſtituted of God, to the intent that Man and Woman ſhould live lawfully in a perpetual Friendſhip, to bring forth Fruit, and to avoid Fornication; by which Mean a good Conſcience might be preſerved on both Parties, in bridling the corrupt inclinations of the Fleſh within the limits of Honeſty; for God hath ſtraitly forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den all Whoredom and Uncleanneſs, and hath from time to time taken grievous puniſhment of this inor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinate Luſt, as all Stories and Ages have declared. Furthermore, It is alſo ordained that the Church of God and his Kingdom might by this kind of life be conſerved and enlarged, not only in that God giveth Children by his Bleſſing, but alſo in that they be brought up by the Parents godly, in the knowledge of Gods Word; that thus the knowledge of God and true Religion might be delivered by Succeſſion from one to another, that finally many might enjoy that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>v<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>rlaſting Immortality. Wherefore, for as much as Matrimony ſerveth us as well to avoid ſin and offence,
<pb n="531" facs="tcp:54673:272"/> as to encreaſe the Kingdom of God; you, as all other which enter the State, muſt acknowledge this benefit of God with pure and thankful minds, for that he hath ſo ruled your hearts that ye follow not the example of the wicked World, who ſet their delight in filthineſs of ſin, but both of you ſtand in the fear of God and ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hor all filthineſs; for that is ſurely the ſingular gift of God where the common example of the World de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clareth how the Devil hath their hearts bound and entangled in divers ſnares, ſo that they in their Wife<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs State run into open abominations without any grudge of their Conſcience. Which ſort of Men that live ſo deſperately and filthy, what damnation tarrieth for them? St. <hi>Paul</hi> deſcribeth it to them, ſaying, <hi>Neither Whoremongers,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">1 Cor. 6.</note> 
                     <hi>neither Adulterers ſhall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herit the Kingdom of God.</hi> This horrible Judgment of God ye be eſcaped through his mercy, if ſo be that ye live inſeparatly, according to Gods Ordinance. But yet I would not have you careleſs without watching; for the Devil will aſſay to attempt all things to inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt and hinder your Hearts and godly Purpoſe, if ye will give him any entry. For he will either labor to break this godly knot once begun betwixt you, or elſe at the leaſt he will labor to incumber it with divers griefs and diſpleaſures.</p>
                  <p>And this is the principal craft to work diſſenſion of Hearts of the one from the other; that whereas now there is pleaſant and ſweet Love betwixt you, he will in the ſtead thereof bring in moſt bittet and unpleaſant diſcord; and ſurely, that ſame Adverſary of ours doth, as it were from above, aſſault Mans nature and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition. For this folly is ever from our tender Age grown up with us, to have a deſire to rule, to think highly of our ſelves, ſo that none thinketh it meet to give place to another. That wicked Voice of ſtubborn Will and Self-love, is more meet to break and to diſſever the love of Heart than to preſerve Concord. Wherefore married Perſons muſt apply their minds in moſt earneſt wiſe to Concord, and muſt crave conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually
<pb n="532" facs="tcp:54673:273"/> of God the help of his Holy Spirit, ſo to rule their Hearts and to knit their Minds together, that they be not diſſevered by any Diviſion or Diſcord. This neceſſity of Prayer muſt be oft in practice and uſing of married Perſons, that oft times the one ſhould pray for the other, leſt hate and debate do ariſe betwixt them. And becauſe few do conſider this thing, but more few do perform it, (I ſay, to pray diligent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly) we ſee how wonderfully the Devil deludeth and ſcorneth this State; how few Matrimonies there be without Chidings, Brawlings, Tauntings, Repentings, bitter Curſings and Fightings; which things whoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever doth commit, they do not conſider, that it is the inſtigation of the Ghoſtly Enemy, who taketh great delight therein; for elſe they would with all earneſt endeavor ſtrive againſt theſe miſchiefs, not only with Prayer but alſo with all poſſible diligence; yea, they would not give place to the provocation of Wrath, which ſtirreth them either to ſuch rough and ſharp Words or Stripes, which is ſurely compaſſed by the Devil, whoſe temptation if it be followed, muſt needs begin and weave the Web of all Miſeries and Sorrows. For this is moſt certainly true, that of ſuch beginnings muſt needs enſue the breach of true Concord in Heart, whereby all Love muſt needs ſhortly be baniſhed. Then can it not be but a miſerable thing to behold, that yet they are of neceſſity compelled to live toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, which yet cannot be in quiet together. And this is moſt cuſtomably every where to be ſeen: But what is the cauſe thereof? Forſooth, becauſe they will not conſider the crafty Trains of the Devil, and therefore give not themſelves to pray to God that he would vouchſafe to repreſs his Power. Moreover, they do not conſider how they promote the purpoſe of the Devil, in that they follow the wrath of their hearts while they threat one another, while they in their fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly turn all upſide down, while they will never give o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver their right, as they eſteem it; yea, while many times they will not give over the wrong part indeed.
<pb n="533" facs="tcp:54673:273"/> Learn thou therefore if thou deſireſt to be void of all theſe miſeries, if thou deſireſt to live peaceably and comfortably in Wedlock, how to make thy earneſt Prayer to God, that he would govern both your Hearts by the Holy Spirit, to reſtrain the Devils power, whereby your Concord may remain perpetually. But to this Prayer muſt be joyned a ſingular diligence, whereof St. <hi>Peter</hi> giveth this precept, ſaying, <hi>You Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands, deal with your Wives according to knowledge, giving honor to the Wife as unto the weaker Veſſel, and as unto them that are Heirs alſo of the grace of Life, that your Prayers be not hindred.</hi> This precept doth particularly pertain to the Husband, for he ought to be the Leader and Author of Love, in cheriſhing and increa ing Concord, which then ſhall take place if he will uſe Moderation and not Tyranny, and if he yield ſomething to the Woman: For the Woman is a weak Creature, not indued with like ſtrength and conſtancy of Mind, therefore they be the ſooner diſquieted; and they be the more prone to all weak affections and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions of Mind more than Men be, and lighter they be, and more vain in their Fantaſies and Opinions. Theſe things muſt be conſidered of the Man, that he be not too ſtiff, ſo that he ought to wink at ſome things, and muſt gently expound all things, and to forbear. Howbeit, The common ſort of Men do judge that ſuch moderation ſhould not become a Man; for they ſay that it is a token of Womaniſh cowardneſs, and therefore they think that it is a Mans part to fume in anger, to fight with Fiſt and Staff. Howbeit, Howſoever they imagine, undoubtedly St. <hi>Peter</hi> doth better judge what ſhould be ſeeming to a Man, and what he ſhould moſt reaſonably perform; for he ſaith, <hi>Reaſoning ſhould be uſed and not Fighting.</hi> Yea, he ſaith more, <hi>That the Woman ought to have a certain honor attributed to her,</hi> that is to ſay, ſhe muſt be ſpared and born with the rather, for that ſhe is the weaker Veſſel, of a frail heart, inconſtant, and with a word ſoon ſtirred to wrath. And therefore conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="534" facs="tcp:54673:274"/> theſe her Frailties, ſhe is to be the rather ſpared: By this means thou ſhalt not only nouriſh Concord, but ſhalt have her Heart in thy power and will; for honeſt Natures will ſooner be retained to do their Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, rather by gentle Words than by Stripes. But he which will do all things with extremity and ſeverity, and doth uſe always rigor in Words and Stripes, what will that avail in the concluſion? Verily nothing, but that he thereby ſetteth forward the Devils work; he baniſheth away Concord, Charity and ſweet Amity, and bringeth in Diſſention, Hatred and Irkſomneſs, the greateſt griefs that can be in the mutual love and fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowſhip of Mans Life. Beyond all this, it bringeth ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther evil therewith, for it is the deſtruction and inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption of Prayer; for in the time that the Mind is oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupied with Diſſention and Diſcord, there can be no true Prayer uſed. For the Lords Prayer hath not only a reſpect to particular Perſons, but to the whole Univerſal, in the which we openly pronounce that we will forgive them which have offended againſt us, even as we ask forgiveneſs of our ſins of God; which thing, how can it be done rightly when their hearts be at diſſention? how can they pray each for other when they be at hate betwixt themſelves? Now, if the aid of Prayer be taken away, by what means can they ſuſtain them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in any comfort? For they cannot otherwiſe either reſiſt the Devil, or yet have their hearts ſtaid in ſtable comfort in all perils and neceſſities but by Prayer. Thus all diſcommodities, as well Worldly as Ghoſtly, follow this froward teſtineſs and cumb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous fierceneſs, in manners which be more meet for brute Beaſts, than for reaſonable Creatures. St. <hi>Peter</hi> doth not allow theſe things, but the Devil deſireth them gladly; wherefore take the more heed. And yet a Man may be a Man although he doth not uſe ſuch extremity, yea, although he ſhould diſſemble ſome things in his Wives manners. And this is the part of a Chriſtian Man, which both pleaſeth God, and ſerveth alſo in good uſe, to the comfort of their
<pb n="535" facs="tcp:54673:274"/> Marriage State. Now as concerning the Wives Duty, What ſhall become her? Shall ſhe abuſe the gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and humanity of her Husband, and at her plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure turn all things upſide down? No ſurely, for that is far repugnant againſt Gods Commandment; For thus doth St. <hi>Peter</hi> preach to them, <hi>Ye Wives,</hi>

                     <hi>be ye in ſubjection to obey your own Husbands.</hi> To obey is another thing than to controle or command, which yet they may do to their Children and to their Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. But as for their Husbands, them muſt they obey, and ceaſe from commanding, and perform ſubjection. For this ſurely doth nouriſh Concord very much, when the Wife is ready at hand at her Husbands com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment, when ſhe will apply her ſelf to his Will, when ſhe endeavoreth her ſelf to ſeek his contenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and to do him pleaſure, when ſhe will eſchew all things that might offend him: For thus will moſt truly be verified the ſaying of the Poet, <hi>A good Wife by obeying her Husband ſhall bear the Rule<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Therefore let them beware that they ſtand not in their faults and wilfulneſs; but rather let them acknowledge their Follies, and ſay, My Husband, ſo it is, that by my anger I was compelled to do this or that, forgive it me, and hereafter I will take better heed. Thus ought the Woman more readily to do, the more they be ready to offend. And they ſhall not do this on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to avoid Strife and debate, but rather in the reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect of the Commandment of God, as St. <hi>Paul</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſeth it in this form of words, <hi>Let Women be ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to their Husbands, as to the Lord;</hi>

<pb n="536" facs="tcp:54673:275"/> is the Head of the Woman as Chriſt is the Head of the Church.</hi> Here you underſtand that God hath commanded that ye ſhould acknowledge the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of the Husband, and refer to him the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor of Obedience. And St. <hi>Peter</hi> ſaith in that place before rehearſed, that holy Matrons did in former time deck themſelves, not with Gold and Silver, but in putting their whole hope in God, and in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beying their Husbands, as <hi>Sarah</hi> obeyed <hi>Abraham,</hi> calling him Lord, <hi>Whoſe Daughters ye be</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>if ye follow her Example.</hi> This Sentence is very meet for Women to print in their remembrance. Truth it is, that they muſt ſpecially feel the grief and pains of their Matrimony, in that they relinquiſh the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty of their own Rule, in the pain of their Travel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, in the bringing up of their Children. In which Offices they be in great Perils, and be grieved with great Afflictions, which they might be without if they lived out of Matrimony. But St. <hi>Peter</hi> ſaith, <hi>That this is the chief Ornament of holy Matrons, in that they ſet their hope and truſt in God;</hi> that is to ſay, in that they refuſed not from Marriage for the buſineſs thereof, for the gifts and perils thereof; but committed all ſuch Adventures to God, in moſt ſure truſt of help, after that they have called up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his aid. O Woman! do thou the like, and ſo ſhalt thou be moſt excellently beautified before God and all his Angels and Saints, and thou needeſt not to ſeek further for doing any better works; for, obey thy Husband, take regard of his Requeſts, and give heed unto him to perceive what he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireth of thee, and ſo ſhalt thou honor God, and live peaceably in thy Houſe. And beyond all this, God ſhall follow thee with his Benediction, that all things ſhall well proſper both to thee and to thy Husband, as the Pſalm ſaith, <hi>Bleſſed is the Man which feareth God, and walketh in his ways, thou ſhalt have the Fruit of thine own hands, happy ſhalt thou be, and well it ſhall go with
<pb n="537" facs="tcp:54673:275"/> thee. Thy Wife ſhall be as a Vine, plentifully ſpreading about thy Houſe. Thy Children ſhall be as the young Springs of the Olives about thy Table. Lo, thus ſhall that Man be bleſſed</hi> (ſaith <hi>David) that feareth the Lord.</hi> This let the Wife have e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver in mind, the rather admoniſhed thereto by the Apparel of her Head, whereby is ſignified that ſhe is under covert or obedience of her Husband. And as that Apparel is of Nature ſo appointed, to declare her ſubjection; ſo biddeth St. <hi>Paul,</hi> that all other of her Raiment ſhould expreſs both Shamefacedneſs and Sobriety. For if it be not lawful for the Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man to have her Head bare, but to bear thereon the Sign of her Power whereſoever ſhe goeth; more is it required that ſhe declare the thing that is meant thereby. And therefore thoſe Ancient Women of the old World called their Husbands Lords, and ſhewed them reverence in obeying them. But peradventure ſhe will ſay, That thoſe Men loved their Wives indeed. I know that well enough, and bear it well in mind; but when I do admoniſh you of your Duties, then call not to conſideration what their Duties be. For when we our ſelves do teach our Children to obey us as their Parents; or when we reform our Servants, and tell them that they ſhould obey their Maſters, not only at the Eye, but as the Lord; if they ſhould tell us again our Duties, we ſhould not think it well done; for when we be admoniſhed of our Duties and Faults, we ought not then to ſeek what other Mens Duties be. For though a Man had a Companion in his fault, yet ſhould he not thereby be without his fault. But this muſt be only looked on, by what means thou mayeſt make thy ſelf without blame; for <hi>Adam</hi> did lay the blame upon the Woman, and ſhe turned it unto the Serpent; but yet neither of them was thus excuſed; and therefore bring not ſuch excuſes to me at this time, but apply all thy diligence to hear thine obedience to thine Husband. For when I take in hand to admoniſh thy Husband to love
<pb n="538" facs="tcp:54673:276"/> thee, and to cheriſh thee, yet will I not ceaſe to ſet out the Law that is appointed for the Woman, as well as I would require of the Man what is written for his Law. Go thou therefore about ſuch things as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cometh thee only, and ſhew thy ſelf tractable to thy Husband; or rather if thou wilt obey thy Husband for Gods precept, then alledge ſuch things as be in his du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to do, but perform thou diligently thoſe things which the Law-maker hath charged thee to do; for thus is it moſt reaſonable to obey God, if thou wilt not ſuffer thy ſelf to tranſgreſs his Law. He that lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth his Friend ſeemeth to do no great thing, but he that honoreth that is hurtful and hateful to him, this Man is worthy moſt commendation; even ſo think you, if thou canſt ſuffer an extream Husband, thou ſhalt have a great reward therefore; but if thou loveſt him only becauſe he is courteous, what reward will God give thee therefore? Yet I ſpeak not theſe things that I would wiſh the Husbands to be ſharp towards their Wives; but I exhort the Women that they would patiently bear the ſharpneſs of their Husbands. For when either Parties do their beſt to perform their Duties the one to the other, then followeth thereon great profit to their Neighbors for their Examples ſake. For when the Woman is ready to ſuffer a ſharp Husband, and the Man will not extreamly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat his ſtubborn and troubleſome Wife, then be all things in quiet, as in a moſt ſure Haven. Even thus was it done in old time, that every one did their own Duty and Office, and was not buſie to require the Duty of their Neighbors. Conſider, I pray thee, that <hi>Abraham</hi> took to him his Brothers Son, his Wife did not blame him therefore. He commanded him to go with him a long Journey, ſhe did not gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſay it, but obeyed his precept.</p>
                  <p>Again, after all thoſe great miſeries, labors and pains of that Journey, when <hi>Abraham</hi> was made as Lord over all, yet did he give place to <hi>Lot</hi> of his Superiority; which matter <hi>Sarah</hi> took ſo little to
<pb n="539" facs="tcp:54673:276"/> grief, that ſhe never once ſuffered her Tongue to ſpeak ſuch words, as the common manner of Women is wont to do in theſe days, when they ſee their Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands in ſuch Rooms, to be made Underlings, and to be put under their Youngers; then they upbraid them with cumbrous Talk, and call them Fools, Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtards and Cowards for ſo doing. But <hi>Sarah</hi> was ſo far from ſpeaking any ſuch thing, that it came never into her mind &amp; thought ſo to ſay, but allowed the Wiſdom and Will of her Husband. Yea, beſides all this, after the ſaid <hi>Lot</hi> had thus his Will, and left to his Uncle the leſs portion of Land, he chanced to fall into ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tream Peril; which chance when it came to the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of this ſaid Patriarch, he incontinently put all his Men in harneſs, and prepared himſelf with all his Family and Friends, againſt the Hoſt of the <hi>Perſians.</hi> In which caſe, <hi>Sarah</hi> did not counſel him to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, nor did ſay, as then might have been ſaid, My Husband, whither goeſt thou ſo unadviſedly? Why runneſt thou thus on head? Why doſt thou offer thy ſelf to ſo great Perils, and art thus ready to jeopard thine own Life, and to peril the Lives of all thine for ſuch a Man as hath done thee ſuch wrong? At the leaſt way, if thou regardeſt not thy ſelf, yet have compaſſion on me, which for thy love have forſaken my Kindred and my Countrey, and have the want both of my Friends and Kinsfolk, and am thus come into ſo far Countries with thee; have pity on me, and make me not here a Widow, to caſt me into ſuch cares and troubles. Thus might ſhe have ſaid; but <hi>Sarah</hi> neither ſaid nor thought ſuch words, but ſhe kept her ſelf in ſilence in a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>l things. Furthermore, all that time when ſhe was Barren, and took no Pains as other Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men did, by bringing forth Fruit in his Houſe; What did he? he complained not to his Wife, but to Almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty God. And conſider how either of them did their Duties as became them; for neither did he deſpiſe <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rah</hi> becauſe ſhe was Barren, nor never did caſt it in her teeth. Conſider again how <hi>Abraham</hi> expelled the
<pb n="540" facs="tcp:54673:277"/> Hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maid out of the Houſe when ſhe required it; ſo that by this I may truly prove, that the one was pleaſed and contented with the other in all things; but yet ſet not your eyes only on this matter, but look further what was done before this, that <hi>Hagar</hi> uſed her Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſs deſpitefully, and that <hi>Abraham</hi> himſelf was ſomewhat provoked againſt her, which muſt needs be an intolerable matter and a painful, to a free-hearted Woman and a chaſt. Let not therefore the Woman be too buſie to call for the Duty of her Husband, where ſhe ſhould be ready to perform her own, for that is not worthy any great commendations. And even ſo again, let not the Man only conſider what belongeth to the Woman, and to ſtand too earneſtly gazing thereon, for that is not his part or duty. But as I have ſaid, let either Party be ready and willing to perform that which belongeth eſpecially to themſelves. For if we be bound to hold out our left cheek to ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers which will ſmite us on the right cheek, how much more ought we to ſuffer an extream and unkind Husband? but yet I mean not that a Man ſhould beat his Wife, God forbid that, for that is the greateſt ſhame that can be, not ſo much to her that is beaten as to him that doth the deed. But if by ſuch Fortune thou chanceſt upon ſuch an Husband, take it not too heavily, but ſuppoſe thou that thereby is laid up no ſmall Reward hereafter, and in this life time no ſmall Commendation to thee, if thou canſt be quiet. But yet to you that be Men, thus I ſpeak, Let there be none ſo grievous Fault to compel you to beat your Wives. But what ſay I, your Wives? No, it is not to be born with that an honeſt Man ſhould lay hands on his Maid-Servant to beat her. Wherefore, if it be a great ſhame for a Man to beat his Bond-Servant, much more rebuke, it is to lay violent hands upon his Free-Woman. And this thing may be well underſtood by the Laws which the Paynims have made, which do diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge her any longer to dwell with ſuch an Husband, as unworthy to have any further company with her that
<pb n="541" facs="tcp:54673:277"/> doth ſmite her. For it is an extreme Point, thus ſo vilely to entreat her like a Slave, that is fellow to thee of thy Life, and ſo joyned unto thee before<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time in the neceſſary matters of thy living. And therefore a Man may well liken ſuch a Man (if he may be called a Man, rather than a wild Beaſt) to a killer of his Father or Mother. And whereas we be commanded to forſake our Father and Mother, for our Wives ſake, and yet thereby do work them none injury, but do fulfil the Law of God; how can it not appear then to be a Point of extreme madneſs, to entreat her deſpitefully, for whoſe ſake God hath commanded thee to leave Parents? Yea, who can ſuffer ſuch deſpite? Who can worthily expreſs the inconveniency, that is, to ſee what weepings and wailings be made in the open Streets, when Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bors run together to the Houſe of ſo unruly an Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band, as to a Bedlam-man, who goeth about to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn all that he hath at home? Who would not think that it were better for ſuch a Man to wiſh the Ground to open, and ſwallow him in, than once ever after to be ſeen in the Market? But peradventure thou wilt Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, that the Woman provoketh thee to this Point. But conſider thou again, that the Woman is a frail Veſſel, and thou art therefore made the Ruler and Head o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

And therefore ſtudy thou to declare the honeſt commendation of thy Authority, which thou canſt no way better do, than to forbear to urge her in her weakneſs and ſubjection. For even as the King appeareth ſo much the more Noble, the more Excellent and Noble he maketh his Officers and Lieutenants, whom if he ſhould diſhonor, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſe the Authority of their Dignity, he ſhould deprive himſelf of a great part of his own Honor: Even ſo, if thou doſt deſpiſe her that is ſet in the next room be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide thee, thou doſt much derogate and decay the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency and Vertue of thine own Authority. Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count all theſe things in thy mind, and be gentle and
<pb n="542" facs="tcp:54673:278"/> quiet. Underſtand that God hath given thee Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren with her, and art made a Father, and by ſuch reaſon appeaſe thy ſelf. Doſt thou not ſee the Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandmen, what diligence they uſe to Till that Ground which once they have taken to Farm, though it be never ſo full of faults? As for an Example, though it be Dry, though it bringeth forth Weeds, though the Soil cannot bear too much Wet; yet he Tilleth it, and ſo winneth Fruit thereof: Even in like manner, if thou wouldſt uſe like diligence to inſtruct and order the mind of thy Spouſe, if thou wouldſt diligently apply thy ſelf to weed out by little and little the noyſom Weeds of uncomely Manners out of her mind, with wholſome precepts, it could not be, but in time thou ſhouldſt feel the pleaſant Fruit thereof to both your comforts. Therefore that this thing chance not ſo, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form this thing that I do here Counſel thee: Whenſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver any diſpleaſant matter riſeth at home, if thy Wife hath done ought amiſs, comfort her, and encreaſe not the Heavineſs. For though thou ſhouldſt be grieved with never ſo many things, yet ſhalt thou find no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more grievous than to want the benevolence of thy Wife at home. What offence ſoever thou canſt name, yet ſhalt thou find none more intolerable, than to be at debate with thy Wife. And for this cauſe, moſt of all oughteſt thou to have this love in Reverence. And if reaſon moveth thee to bear any burden at any other Mans hands, much more at thy Wives. For if ſhe be poor, upbraid her not; if ſhe be ſimple, taunt her not, but be the more courteous; for ſhe is thy Body, and made one Fleſh with thee. But thou peradventure wilt ſay, that ſhe is a wrath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Woman, a Drunkard, and Beaſtly, without Wit or Reaſon. For this cauſe bewail her the more. Chafe not in Anger, but Pray unto Almighty God. Let her be admoniſhed and helped with good Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel, and do thou thy beſt endeavor, that ſhe may be delivered of all theſe affections. But if thou ſhouldſt beat her, thou ſhalt increaſe her evil affections, for
<pb n="543" facs="tcp:54673:278"/> frowardneſs and ſharpneſs is not amended with frow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ardneſs, but with ſoftneſs and gentleneſs. Further<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more, conſider what reward thou ſhalt have at Gods hand; for where thou mighteſt beat her, and yet, for the reſpect of the fear of God, thou wilt abſtain and bear patiently her great offences, the rather in reſpect of that Law which forbiddeth that a Man ſhould caſt out his Wife, what fault ſoever ſhe be cumbred with, thou ſhalt have a very great reward; and before the receit of that reward, thou ſhalt feel many commodities. For by this means ſhe ſhall be made the more Obedient, and thou for her ſake ſhalt be made the more meek. It is written in a Story of a certain ſtrange Philoſopher, which had a curſed Wife, a froward, and a Drunkard: When he was asked for what conſideration he did ſo bear her evil manners? He made Anſwer, <hi>By this means</hi> (ſaid he) <hi>I have at home a School-Maſter, and an Example how I ſhould behave my ſelf abroad; For I ſhall</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>be the more quiet with others, being thus daily exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed and taught in the forbearing her.</hi> Surely it is a ſhame that Paynims ſhould be wiſer than we; we, I ſay, that be commanded to reſemble Angels, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther God himſelf through meekneſs. And for the love of Vertue, this ſaid Philoſopher <hi>Socrates</hi> would not expel his Wife out of his Houſe. Yea ſome ſay that he did therefore marry his Wife, to learn this Vertue by that occaſion. Wherefore, ſeeing many Men be far be hind the wiſdom of this Man, my Counſel is, that firſt &amp; before all things, a Man do his beſt endeavor to get him a good Wife, endued with all Honeſty and Vertue: But if it ſo chance that he is deceived, that he hath choſen ſuch a Wife as is neither good nor to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerable, then let the Husband follow this Philoſopher, and let him inſtruct his Wife in every condition, and never lay theſe matters to ſight. For the Merchant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, except he be firſt at compoſition with his Factor to uſe his interfairs quietly, he will neither ſtir his Ship to ſail, nor yet will lay hands upon his Merchan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſe:
<pb n="544" facs="tcp:54673:279"/> Even ſo, let us do all things, that we may have the fellowſhip of our Wives, which is the Factor of all our doings at home, in great quiet and reſt. And by theſe means all things ſhall proſper quietly, and ſo ſhall we paſs through the dangers of the troublous Sea of this World. For this ſtate of life will be more Honorable and Comfortable than our Houſes, than Servants, than Mony, than Lands and Poſſeſſions, than all things that can be told. As all theſe with Sedition and Diſcord, can never work us any com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort: So ſhall all things turn to our Commodity and Pleaſure, if we draw this Yoke in one concord of Heart and Mind. Whereupon do your beſt endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vor, that after this ſort ye uſe your Matrimony, and ſo ſhall ye be armed on every ſide. Ye have eſcaped the ſnares of the Devil, and the unlawful luſts of the Fleſh, ye have the quietneſs of Conſcience by this inſtruction of Matrimony ordained by God; therefore uſe oft Prayer to him, that he would be preſent by you, that he would continue Concord and Charity betwixt you. Do the beſt you can of your parts, to Cuſtom your ſelves to ſoftneſs and meekneſs, and bear well in worth ſuch overſights as chance; and thus ſhall your Converſation be moſt pleaſant and comfortable. And although (which can no other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe be) ſome Adverſities ſhall follow, and other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>whiles now one diſcommodity, now another ſhall appear; yet in this common Trouble and Adverſity, lift up both your Hands unto Heaven, call upon the help and aſſiſtance of God, the Author of your Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage, and ſurely the promiſe of relief is at hand. For Chriſt affirmeth in his Goſpel, Where two or three be gathered together in my Name, and be agreed, what matter ſoever they Pray for, it ſhall be granted them of my Heavenly Father. Why there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſhouldſt thou be afraid of the danger, where thou haſt ſo ready a Promiſe, and ſo nigh an Help? Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thermore, you muſt underſtand how neceſſary it is for Chriſtian Folk to bear Chriſts Croſs; for elſe we
<pb n="545" facs="tcp:54673:279"/> ſhall never feel how comfortable Gods help is unto us. Therefore give thanks to God for his great benefit, in that ye have taken upon you this ſtate of Wed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lock, and Pray ye inſtantly, that Almighty God may luckily defend and maintain ye therein, that neither ye be overcome with any Temptations, nor with any Adverſity. But before all things, take good heed that ye give no occaſion to the Devil to let and hinder your Prayers by Diſcord and Diſſention; for there is no ſtronger defence and ſtay in all our life, than is Prayer, in the which we may call for the help of God and obtain it, whereby we may win his Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing, his Grace, his Defence and Protection, ſo to continue therein, to a better life to come: Which grant us, he that died for us all, to whom be all Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor and Praiſe, for ever and ever.

                  <p>Almighty God, after that he had Created Man, put him into Paradiſe, that he might dreſs and keep it; but when he had tranſgreſſed Gods Commandment, Eating the Fruit of the Tree which was forbidden him, Almighty God fort with did caſt him out of Paradiſe into this woful Vail of Miſery,<note place="margin">Gen. 3.</note> enjoyning him to La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bor the Ground that he was taken out of, and to eat his Bread in the ſweat of his Face all the days of his Life. It is the appoinment and will of God, that every Man, during the time of this Mortal and Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitory life, ſhould give himſelf to ſuch Honeſt and Godly Exerciſe and Labor, and every one follow his own buſineſs, and to walk uprightly in his own Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling. <hi>Man</hi> (ſaith <hi>Job) is born to Labor.</hi>

                     <hi>to drink the Waters of our own Cistern, and of the Rivers that run out of the midſt of our own Well;</hi> meaning thereby, that we ſhould live of our own Labors, and not devour the Labors of others.<note place="margin">2 Theſſ. 3.</note> St. <hi>Paul</hi> hearing that among the <hi>Theſſalonians</hi> there were certain that lived diſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely and out of order, that is to ſay, which did not work, but were buſie-bodies; not getting their own living with their own Travel, but eating other Mens Bread of free-coſt, did command the ſaid <hi>Theſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonians,</hi> not only to withdraw themſelves, and abſtain from the familiar company of ſuch inordinate perſons, but alſo that if there were any ſuch among them that would not Labor, the ſame ſhould not Eat, nor have any Living at other Mens hands. Which Doctrin of St. <hi>Paul</hi> (no doubt) is grounded upon the general Ordinance of God, which is, that every Man ſhould Labor: And therefore it is to be obeyed of all Men, and no Man can juſtly exempt himſelf from the ſame. But when it is ſaid, all Men ſhould Labor, it is not
<pb n="548" facs="tcp:54673:281"/> ſo ſtreightly meant, that all Men ſhould uſe handy Labor. But as there be divers ſorts of Labors, ſome of the Mind, and ſome of the Body, and ſome of both: So every one (except by reaſon of Age, debility of Body, or want of Health, he be unapt to Labor at all) ought both for the getting of his own living ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly, and for to profit others, in ſome kind of La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bor to exerciſe himſelf, according as the Vocation whereunto God hath called him ſhall require. So that whoſoever doth good to the Common Weal and Society of Men with his Induſtry and Labor, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it be by Governing the Common Weal publickly, or by bearing publick Office or Miniſtry, or by doing any common neceſſary affairs of his Country, or by giving Counſel, or by teaching and inſtructing o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, or by what other means ſoever he be occupied, ſo that a profit and benefit redound thereof unto o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, the ſame perſon is not to be accounted Idle, though he work no Bodily Labor, nor is to be denied his living (if he attended his Vocation) though he work not with his hands.</p>
                  <p>Bodily Labor is not required of them which by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of their Vocation and Office are Occupied in the Labor of the Mind, to the ſuccour and help of others. St. <hi>Paul</hi> exhorteth <hi>Timothy</hi> to eſchew and refuſe Idle Widows,<note place="margin">1 Tim. 5.</note> 
                     <hi>which go about from Houſe to Houſe, becauſe they are not only Idle, but Pratlers alſo, and Buſie-bodies, ſpeaking things which are not comely.</hi> The Prophet <hi>Ezekiel,</hi> declaring what the Sins of the City of <hi>Sodom</hi> were, reckoneth Idleneſs to be one of the principle.<note place="margin">Ezek. 16.</note> 
                     <hi>The Sins</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>of</hi> Sodom <hi>were theſe, Pride, fulneſs of Meat, Abundance, and Idleneſs.</hi> Theſe things had <hi>Sodom</hi> and her Daughters, meaning the Cities ſubject to her. The horrible and ſtrange kind of Deſtruction of that City, and all the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try about the ſame, (which was Fire and Brimſtone raining from Heaven) moſt manifeſtly declareth, what a grievous Sin Idleneſs is, and ought to admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh us to flee from the ſame, and embrace Honeſt
<pb n="549" facs="tcp:54673:281"/> and Godly Labor. But if we give our ſelves to Idle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and Sloth, to Lurking and Loitering, to wilful Wandring, and waſtful Spending, never ſetling our ſelves to Honeſt Labor, but living like drone Bees by the Labors of other Men, then do we break the Lords Commandment, we go aſtray from our Voca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and incur the danger of Gods wrath and heavy diſpleaſure, to our endleſs deſtruction, except by Repentance we turn again unfeignedly unto God. The inconveniencies and miſchiefs that come of Idle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, as well to Mans Body as to his Soul, are more than can in ſhort time be well rehearſed. Some we ſhall declare and open unto you, that by conſidering them, ye may the better with your ſelves gather the reſt. <hi>An Idle Hand</hi> (ſaith <hi>Soloman) maketh Poor,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Prov. 10. Prov. 11.28. Prov. 10.</note> 
                     <hi>but a quick Laboring Hand maketh Rich.</hi> Again, <hi>He that Tilleth his Land, ſhall have plenteouſneſs of Bread, but he that floweth in Idleneſs is a very Fool, and ſhall have Poverty enough.</hi> Again, <hi>A Sloathful Body will not go to Plough for cold of Winter, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſhall he go a begging in the Summer, and have nothing.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But what ſhall we need to ſtand much about the proving this, that Poverty followeth Idleneſs: We have too much experience thereof (the thing is the more to be lamented) in this Realm. For a great part of the beggery that is among the Poor, can be imputed to nothing ſo much as to Idleneſs, and to the negligence of Parents, which do not bring up their Children either in good Learning, Honeſt Labor, or ſome commendable Occupation or Trade, whereby when they come to Age, they might get their living. Daily Experience alſo teacheth, that nothing is more an enemy or pernicious to the health of Mans Body, than is Idleneſs, too much Eaſe and Sleep, and want of Exerciſe. But theſe and ſuch like incommodities, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit they be great and noiſom, yet becauſe they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern chiefly the Body and external Good, they are not to be compared with the miſchiefs and inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niences,
<pb n="550" facs="tcp:54673:282"/> which through Idleneſs happen to the Soul, whereof we will recite ſome. Idleneſs is never alone, but hath always a long Tail of other Vices hanging on, which corrupt and infect the whole Man after ſuch a ſort, that he is made at length, nothing elſe but a lump of Sin. <hi>Idleneſs</hi> (ſaith <hi>Jeſus Sirach) bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth much Evil and Miſchief.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Ecclus 33.</note> St. <hi>Bernard</hi> calleth it the Mother of all Evils, and ſtep-dame of all Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues, adding moreover, that it doth prepare, and (as it were) tread the way to Hell Fire. Where Idle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs is once received, there the Devil is ready to ſet in his Foot, and to plant all kind of Wickedneſs and Sin, to the everlaſting Deſtruction of Mans Soul. Which thing to be moſt true, we are taught plainly in the 13.<note place="margin">Matt. 13.</note> of <hi>Matthew,</hi> where it is ſaid, <hi>that the Enemy came while Men were aſleep, and Sowed naughty Tares among the good Wheat.</hi> In very deed, the beſt time that the Devil can have to work his feat, is when Men be aſleep, that is to ſay, Idle: Then is he moſt buſie in his work, then doth he ſooneſt catch Men in the ſnare of Perdition, then doth he fill them with all iniquity, to bring them (without Gods ſpecial favor) unto utter Deſtruction. Hereof we have two notable Examples, moſt lively ſet before our Eyes. The one in King <hi>David,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">1 Kings 11.</note> who tarrying at home Idly (as the Scripture ſaith) at ſuch times as other Kings go forth to Battle, was quickly ſeduced of Satan to forſake the Lord his God,<note place="margin">2 Kings 12.</note> and to commit two grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous and abominable ſins in his ſight, Adultery and Murder.</p>
                  <p>The Plagues that enſued theſe Offences were horrible and grievous, as it may eaſily appear to them that will read the Story.<note place="margin">Judg. 16.</note> Another example of <hi>Samſon,</hi> who ſo long as he Warred with the <hi>Philiſtines,</hi> Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies to the People of God, could never be taken or overcome: But after that he gave himſelf to Eaſe and Idleneſs, he not only committed Fornication with the Strumpet <hi>Dalila,</hi> but alſo was taken of his Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, and had his Eyes miſerably put out, was put in
<pb n="551" facs="tcp:54673:282"/> Priſon, and compelled to grind in a Mill, and at length was made the laughing ſtrock of his Enemies. If theſe two, who were ſo excellent Men, ſo wellbeloved of God, ſo endued with ſingular and Divine Gifts, the one namely of Prophecy, and the other of Strength, and ſuch Men as never could by Vexation, Labor, or Trouble, be overcome, were overthrown and fell in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to grievous Sins by giving themſelves for a ſhort time to Eaſe and Idleneſs, and ſo conſequently incurred miſerable Plagues at the hands of God: What Sin? What Miſchief? What Inconvenience and Plagues is not to be feared of them, which all their life long give themſelves wholly to Idleneſs and Eaſe? Let us not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive our ſelves, thinking little hurt to come of doing nothing; for it is a true ſaying, When one doth nothing, he learneth to do Evil. Let us therefore always be do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of ſome honeſt Work, that the Devil may find us Occupied. He himſelf is ever Occupied, never Idle, but walketh continually ſeeking to devour us. Let us reſiſt him with our diligent Watching, in Labor, and in Well-doing. For he that diligently exerciſeth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in honeſt Buſineſs, is not eaſily catched in the Devils ſnare. When Man through Idleneſs, or for defalt of ſome honeſt Occupation or Trade to live upon, is brought to Poverty, and want of things neceſſary, we ſee how eaſily ſuch a Man is induced for his gain, to Lie, to Practice how he may deceive his Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bor, to forſwear himſelf, to bear falſe Witneſs, and oftentimes to Steal and Murder, or to uſe ſome other ungodly mean to live withal; whereby not only his good Name, honeſt Reputation, and a good Conſcience, yea, his Liſe is utterly loſt, but alſo the great diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure and wrath of God, with divers and ſundry grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous Plagues are procured. Lo here the end of the Idle and Sluggiſh Bodies, whoſe hands cannot away with honeſt Labor; loſs of Name, Fame, Reputation, and Life, here in this World, and without the great Mercy of God, the purchaſing of Everlaſting Deſtruction in the World to come. Have not all Men then good
<pb n="552" facs="tcp:54673:283"/> cauſe to beware and take heed of Idleneſs, ſeeing they that embrace and follow it, have commonly of their pleaſant Idleneſs, ſharp and ſoure diſpleaſures? Doubtleſs good and godly Men, weighing the great and manifold harms that come by Idleneſs to a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-weal, have from time to time provided with all deligence, that ſharp and ſevere Laws might be made for the Correction and Amendment of this Evil. The Egyptians had a Law,<note place="margin">Herodotus.</note> that every Man ſhould Weekly bring his Name to the chief Rulers of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince, and therewithal declare what trade of Life he uſed, to the intent that Idleneſs might be worthily pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed, and diligent Labor duly rewarded. The <hi>Athe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians</hi> did chaſtiſe Sluggiſh and Sloathful People, no leſs than they did Hainous and Grievous Offenders, conſidering (as the truth is) that Idleneſs cauſeth much miſchief. The <hi>Areopagites</hi> called every Man to a ſtrait accompt how he lived; and if they found any Loyter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers that did not profit the Common-weal by one means or other, they were driven out, and baniſhed, as unprofitable Members, that did only hurt and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt the Body. And in this Realm of <hi>England,</hi> good and godly Laws have been divers times made, that no Idle Vagabonds and Loytering Runnagates, ſhould be ſuffered to go from Town to Town, from Place to Place, without Puniſhment, which neither ſerve God nor their Prince, but devour the ſweet Fruits of other Mens Labor, being common Liars, Drunk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards, Swearers, Thieves, Whoremaſters, and Murder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, refuſing all honeſt Labor, and give themſelves to nothing elſe but to invent and do miſchief, whereof they are more deſirous and greedy than is any Lion of his prey. To remember this inconvenience, let all Parents and others which have the care and governance of Youth, ſo bring them up either in good Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, Labor, or ſome honeſt Occupation or Trade, whereby they may be able in time to come, not only to ſuſtain themſelves competently, but alſo to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

They be worſe than Idle Men indeed, for that they ſeek to have Wages for their Loytering. It is leſs danger to God to be Idle for no gain, than by Idleneſs to win out of their Neighbors Purſe, Wages for that which is not deſerved. It is true, that Almighty God is angry with ſuch as do defraud the Hired Man of his Wages; the cry of that injury aſcendeth up to

                     <hi>Let no Man</hi> (ſaith St. <hi>Paul</hi> to the <hi>Theſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalonians) ſubtilly beguile his Brother, let him not defraud him of his buſineſs: For the Lord is the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venger of ſuch deceits.</hi> Whereupon he that will have a good Conſcience to God, that Laboring Man, I ſay, which dependeth wholly upon Gods benedicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, miniſtring all things ſufficient for his living, let him uſe his time in a faithful Labor, and when his La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bor by Sickneſs or other misfortune doth ceaſe, yet let him think for that in his health he ſerved God and his Neighbor truly, he ſhall not want in time of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity. God upon reſpect of his fidelity in health, will recompence his indigence, to move the Hearts of good Men to relieve ſuch decayed Men in Sickneſs. Where otherwiſe, whatſoever is gotten by idleneſs ſhall have no means to help in time of need.</p>
                  <p>Let the Laboring Man therefore eſchew for his part this vice of Idleneſs and Deceit,<note place="margin">Eph. 4.</note> remembring that St <hi>Paul</hi> exhorteth every Man to lay away all Deceit, Diſſimulation, and Lying, and to uſe truth and plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to his Neighbour, <hi>becauſe</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>we be Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers together in one Body, under one head Chriſt our Saviour.</hi> And here might be charged the Serving<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men of this Realm, who ſpend their time in much Idle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of life, nothing regarding the opportunity of their time, forgetting how Service is no Heritage, how Age will creep upon them; where Wiſdom were, they ſhould expend their Idle time in ſome good Buſineſs, whereby they might increaſe in knowledge, and ſo the more worthy to be ready for every Mans ſervice: It is a great rebuke to them, that they ſtudy not ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to Write fair, to keep a Book of Account, to ſtudy the Tongues, and ſo to get wiſdom and knowledge in ſuch Books and Works, as be now plentifully ſet out in Print of all manner of Languages. Let young Men conſider the precious value of their time, and waſte it not in Idleneſs, in Jollity, in Gaming, in Bant

How merry and glad ſoever thou be in thy Youth, O young Man (ſaith the Preacher) how glad ſoever thy Heart be in thy young days,<note place="margin">Eccleſ. 11.</note> how faſt and freely ſoever thou fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the ways of thine own Heart, and the luſt of thine own Eye, yet be thou ſure that God ſhall bring thee into Judgment for all theſe things.

To leave ſin unpuniſhed, and to neglect the good bringing up of Youth, is nothing elſe but to kindle the Lords wrath againſt us, and to heap Plagues upon our own Heads. As long as the Adulterous people were ſuffered to live Licentiouſly without Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation; ſo long did the Plague continue and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe in <hi>Iſrael,</hi>

                  <p>But when due correction was done upon them, the Lords anger was ſtrait way pacified, and the Plauge ceaſed. Let all Officers therefore look ſtraitly to their charge. Let all Maſters of Houſholds reform this abuſe in their Families; let them uſe the Authority that God hath given them; let them not maintain Vagabonds and Idle perſons, but deliver the Realm and their Houſholds from ſuch noyſom Loyterers, that Idle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs the Mother of all Miſchief, being clean taken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, Almighty God may turn his dreaful Anger away from us, and confirm the Covenant of Peace upon us for ever, through the Merits of Jeſus Chriſt our only Lord and Saviour; to whom with the Father, and the Holy Ghoſt, be all Honor and Glory, World without end.

                     <p>THere is noting that the Holy Ghoſt doth ſo much Labor in all the Scriptures to beat in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Mens Heads, as Repentance, amendment of Life, and ſpeedy returning unto the Lord God of Hoſts. And no marvel why; for we do Daily and Hourly by our wickedneſs and ſtubborn Diſobedience, horribly fall away from God, thereby purchaſing unto our ſelves (if he ſhould deal with us according to his Juſtice) Eternal Damnation.<note place="margin">The Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrin of Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance is moſt neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary.</note> So that no Doctrin is ſo neceſſary in the Church of God, as is the Doctrin of Repentance and amendment of Life. And verily the true Preachers of the Goſpel of the Kingdom of Heaven, and of the glad and joyful tidings of Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, have always in their Godly Sermons and Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings unto the People, joyned theſe two together, I mean Repentance and Forgiveneſs of Sins, even as our Saviour Jeſus Chriſt did appoint himſelf, ſaying, So it behoved Chriſt to Suffer, and to Riſe again the Third Day, and that Repentance and Forgiveneſs of
<pb n="557" facs="tcp:54673:285" rendition="simple:additions"/> ſins ſhould be preached in his Name among all Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. And therefore the holy Apoſtle doth in the <hi>Acts</hi> ſpeak after this manner, <hi>I have witneſſed both to the Jews and to the Gentiles, the Repentance towards God, and Faith towards our Lord Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> Did not <hi>John</hi> Baptiſt, <hi>Zacharias</hi> Son, begin his Miniſtry with the Doctrin of Repentance, ſaying, <hi>Repent, for the Kingdom of God is at hand?</hi> The like Doctrin did our Saviour Jeſus Chriſt preach himſelf, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded his Apoſtles to preach the ſame.</p>
                     <p>I might here alledge very many places out of the Prophets, in the which this moſt wholſom Doctrin of Repentance is very earneſtly urged, as moſt needful for all degrees and orders of Men, but one ſhall be ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient at this preſent time.</p>
                     <p>Theſe are the words of <hi>Joel</hi> the Prophet; therefore alſo now the Lord ſaith,<note place="margin">Joel 2.</note> 
                        <hi>Return unto me with all your heart, with Faſting, Weeping and Mourning; rent your hearts and not your cloaths, and return unto the Lord your God, for he is gracious and merciful, ſlow to anger, and of great compaſſion, and ready to pardon wickedneſs.</hi> Whereby it is given us to underſtand,<note place="margin">A perpetu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Rule which all must fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low.</note> that we have here a perpetual Rule appointed unto us, which ought to be obſerved and kept at all times; and that there is none other way whereby the wrath of God may be pacified, and his anger aſſwaged, that the fierceneſs of his fury and the plagues of deſtruction, which by his righteous Judgment he had determined to bring upon us, may depart, be removed and taken away. Where he ſaith, <hi>But now therefore</hi> (ſaith the Lord,) <hi>return unto me.</hi> It is not without great im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance that the Prophet ſpeaketh ſo; for he had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſet forth at large unto them the horrible Venge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of God, which no Man was able to abide, and therefore he doth move them to Repentance, to obtain Mercy, as if he ſhould ſay, I will not have theſe things to be ſo taken, as though there were no hope of grace left. For although ye do by your ſins deſerve to be utterly deſtroyed, and God by his righteous Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
<pb n="558" facs="tcp:54673:286" rendition="simple:additions"/> hath determined to bring no ſmall deſtruction upon you; yet know that ye are in a manner on the very edge of the Sword; if ye will ſpeedily return un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him, he will moſt gently and moſt mercifully re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive you into favor again. Whereby we are admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed that Repentance is never too late, ſo that it be true and earneſt. For ſith that God in the Scriptures will be called our Father, doubtleſs he doth follow the nature and property of gentle and merciful Fathers, which ſeek nothing ſo much as the returning again, and amendment of their Children, as Chriſt doth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundantly teach in the Parable of the Prodigal Son.<note place="margin">Luke 15.

All which things ought to ſerve for our comfort againſt the temptations of our Conſciences, whereby the Devil goeth about to ſhake, or rather to overthrow our Faith.

<pb n="559" facs="tcp:54673:286" rendition="simple:additions"/> let us more narrowly look upon the Commandment of the Lord touching this matter. <hi>Turn unto me</hi> (ſaith he by the holy Prophet <hi>Joel,) with all your hearts, with Faſting, Weeping and Mourning. Rent your Hearts and not your Garments,</hi> &amp;c. In which words, he comprehendeth all manner of things that can be ſpoken of Repentance, which is a returning a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain of the whole Man unto God, from whom we be fallen away by ſin. But that the whole Diſcourſe there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of may the better be born away; we ſhall firſt conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der in order four principal Points, that is, from what we muſt return, to whom we muſt return, by whom we may be able to convert, and the manner how to turn to God.</p>
                     <p>Firſt,<note place="margin">From whence we muſt turn.</note> From whence or from what things we muſt return? Truly we muſt return from thoſe things whereby we have been withdrawn, pluckt, and led a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way from God. And theſe generally are our ſins, which, as the holy Prophet <hi>Eſay</hi> doth teſtifie, do ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate God and us, and hide his Face, that he will not hear us. But under the name of ſin, not only thoſe groſs words and deeds, which by the common judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Men are counted to be filthy and unlawful, and ſo conſequently abominable ſins; but alſo the fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy Luſts and inward Concupiſcences of the Fleſh, which (as St. <hi>Paul</hi> teſtifieth) do reſiſt the Will and Spirit of God,<note place="margin">Gal. 5.</note> and therefore ought earneſtly to be bridled and kept under. We muſt repent of the falſe and erroneous Opinions that we have had of God, and the wicked Superſtition that doth breed of the ſame, the unlawful worſhipping and ſervice of God, and other like.<note place="margin">Epheſ. 5.</note> All theſe things muſt they forſake that will truly turn unto the Lord and repent aright. For ſith that, for ſuch things the wrath of God cometh upon the Children of diſobedience, no end of puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ought to be looked for, as long as we continue in ſuch things. Therefore they be here condemned which will ſeem to be repentant Sinners, and yet will not forſake their Idolatry and Superſtition. Secondly,
<pb n="560" facs="tcp:54673:287" rendition="simple:additions"/> We muſt ſee unto whom we ought to return;<note place="margin">Unto whom we ought to return.</note> 
                        <hi>Rever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timini uſque ad me,</hi> ſaith the Lord; that is, return as far as unto me. <hi>We muſt then return unto the Lord, yea, we muſt return unto him alone: For he a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone is the Truth, and the Fountain of all goodneſs;</hi> but we muſt labor that we do return as far as unto him, and that we do never ceaſe nor reſt till we have ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended and taken hold upon him.</p>
                     <p>But this muſt be done by Faith; for ſith that God is a Spirit, he can by no other means be apprehended and taken hold upon. Wherefore, firſt, they do great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly err, which do not turn unto God, but unto the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, or unto the inventions of Men, or unto their own Merits. Secondly, They that do begin to return unto the Lord,<note place="margin">By whom we muſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn unto God.</note> and do ſaint in the Midway, before they come to the mark that is appointed unto them. Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, Becauſe we have of our own ſelves nothing to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent us to God, and do no leſs flee from him after our Fall, than our firſt Parent <hi>Adam</hi> did, who when he had ſinned did ſeek to hide himſelf from the ſight of God; we have need of a Mediator for to bring and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concile us unto him, who for our ſins is angry with us. The ſame is Jeſus Chriſt, who being true and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural God, equal, and of one ſubſtance with the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, did at the time appointed take upon him our frail Nature in the bleſſed Virgins Womb, and that of her undefiled Subſtance, that ſo he might be a Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diator between God and us, and pacifie his wrath. Of him doth the Father himſelf ſpeak from Heaven, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,<note place="margin">Mat. 3.</note> 
                        <hi>This is my well-beloved Son, in whom I am well-pleaſed.</hi> And he himſelf in his Goſpel doth cry out and ſay,<note place="margin">John 14.</note> 
                        <hi>I am the Way, the Truth and the Life, no Man cometh unto the Father but by me. For he alone did with the Sacrifice of his Body and Blood,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">John 1. 1 Pet. 1. Acts 5.</note> 
                        <hi>make ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction unto the Justice of God for our ſins.</hi> The Apoſtles do teſtifie that he was exalted for to give re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance and remiſſion of ſins unto <hi>Iſrael;</hi> both which things he himſelf did command to be preached in his name.<note place="margin">Luke 24.</note> Therefore they are greatly deceived that preach
<pb n="561" facs="tcp:54673:287" rendition="simple:additions"/> Repentance without Chriſt,<note place="margin">John 15.</note> and teach the ſimple and ignorant that it conſiſteth only in the Works of Men. They may indeed ſpeak many things of good Works, and of amendment of Life and Manners; but with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Chriſt they be all vain and unprofitable. They that think that they have done much of themſelves towards Repentance, are ſo much more the farther from God, becauſe they do ſeek thoſe things in their own Works and Merits, which ought only to be ſought in our Saviour Jeſus Chriſt, and in the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits of his Death and Paſſion, and Blood-ſhedding. Fourthly, This holy Prophet <hi>Joel</hi> doth lively expreſs the manner of this our Returning or Repentance, comprehending all the inward and outward things that may be here obſerved. Firſt, He will havs us to return unto God with our whole heart,<note place="margin">The man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of our turning. <hi>Eſay 29. Mat. 15.</hi>
                        </note> whereby he doth remove and put away all Hypocriſie, leſt the ſame might juſtly be ſaid unto us, <hi>This People draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth near with their mouth, and worſhip me with their lips, but their heart is far off from me.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Secondly, He requireth a ſincere and pure love of godlineſs, and of the true worſhipping and ſervice of God, that is to ſay, that forſaking all manner of things that are repugnant and contrary unto Gods Will; we do give our hearts unto him, and the whole ſtrength of our Bodies and Souls, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to that which is written in the Law,<note place="margin">Deut. 6.</note> 
                        <hi>Thou ſhalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, with all thy Soul, and with all thy Strength.</hi> Here therefore nothing is leſt unto us that we may give unto the World, and unto the Luſts of the Fleſh. For ſith that the heart is the Fountain of all our Works, as many as do with their whole heart turn unto the Lord, do live unto him only.<note place="margin">Halting on both ſides.</note> Neither do they yet repent truly, that halting on both ſides, do other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>whiles obey God, but by and by do think that lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him aſide, it is lawful for them to ſerve the World and the Fleſh. And becauſe that we are letted by the natural corruption of our own Fleſh, and the wicked
<pb n="562" facs="tcp:54673:288"/> affections of the ſame, he doth bid us alſo to return with Faſting; not thereby underſtanding a ſuperſtitious Abſtinence and chooſing of Meats, but a true Diſcipline or taming of the Fleſh, whereby the nouriſhments of filthy Luſts, and of ſtubborn Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tumacy and Pride, may be withdrawn and pluckt away from it. Whereunto he doth add weeping and mourning, which do contain an outward profeſſion of Repentance, which is very needful and neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, that ſo we may partly ſet forth the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs of God, when by ſuch means we do te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifie that we deſerved puniſhments at his hands, and partly ſtop the offence that was openly given unto the weak.</p>
                     <p>
                        <note place="margin">Pſal. 25.</note>Thus did <hi>David</hi> ſee, who being not content to have bewept and bewailed his ſins privately, would pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickly in his <hi>Pſalms</hi> declare and ſet forth the rigte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs of God in puniſhing ſin, and alſo ſtay them that might have abuſed his Example to ſin the more boldly. Therefore they are fartheſt from true Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, that will not confeſs and acknowledge their ſins, nor yet bewail them, but rather do moſt ungodlily glory and rejoyce in them. Now leſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Man ſhould think that Repentance doth conſiſt in outward weeping and mourning only, he doth re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hearſe that wherein the chief of the whole matter doth lie, when he ſaith, <hi>Rent your Hearts and not your Garments, and turn unto the Lord your God.</hi> For the People of the Eaſt part of the World were wont to rent their Garments,<note place="margin">Pſal. 52.</note> if any thing hapned unto them that ſeemed intolerable.<note place="margin">Hypocrites do counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feit all manner of things.</note> This thing did Hypocrites ſometimes counterfeit and follow, as though the whole Repentance did ſtand in ſuch out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward geſture. He teacheth then, that another manner of thing is required, that is, That they muſt be contrite in their Hearts, that they muſt utterly deteſt and ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hor Sins; and being at defiance with them, return un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Lord their God, from whom they went away before. For God hath no pleaſure in the outward
<pb n="563" facs="tcp:54673:288" rendition="simple:additions"/> Ceremony, but requireth a contrite and humble Heart,<note place="margin">Pſal. 52.</note> which he will never deſpiſe, as <hi>David</hi> doth teſtifie. There is therefore none other uſe of theſe outward Ceremonies, but as far forth as we are ſtirred up by them, and do ſerve to the glory of God, and to the edifying of others.</p>
                     <p>Now doth he add unto this Doctrin or Exhortation,<note place="margin">How Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance is not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>profitable.</note> certain godly Reaſons, which he doth ground up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the nature and property of God, and whereby he doth teach, that true Repentance can never be unprofitable or unfruitful. For as in all other things Mens hearts do quail and faint, if they once perceive that they travel in vain: Even ſo moſt eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially in this matter, muſt we take heed and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware that we ſuffer not our ſelves to be perſuaded, that all that we do is but labor loſt; for thereof either ſudden deſperation doth ariſe, or a licentious boldneſs to ſin, which at length bringeth unto deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peration. Leſt any ſuch thing then ſhould happen unto them, he doth certifie them of the grace and goodneſs of God, who is always moſt ready to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive them into favor again that turn ſpeedily unto him. Which thing he doth prove with the ſame Titles, wherewith God doth deſcribe and ſet forth himſelf unto <hi>Moſes,</hi> ſpeaking on this manner,<note place="margin">Exod. 34.</note> 
                        <hi>For he is gracious and merciful, ſlow to anger, of great kindneſs, and repenteth him of the evil;</hi> that is, ſuch a one as is ſorry for your Afflictions. Firſt, He cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth him gentle and gracious, as he who of his own nature is more prompt and ready to do good than to puniſh. Whereunto this ſaying of <hi>Eſaias</hi> the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet ſeemeth to pertain, where he ſaith,<note place="margin">Eſay. 55.</note> 
                        <hi>Let the wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed forſake his way, and the unrighteous his own ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginations, and return unto the Lord, and he will have pity on him, and to our God, for he is very ready to forgive.</hi> Secondly, Doth attribute unto him mercy, or rather (according to the <hi>Hebrew</hi> word) the Bowels of mercies; whereby he ſignified the natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral affections of Parents towards their Children.
<pb n="564" facs="tcp:54673:289" rendition="simple:additions"/> Which thing <hi>David</hi> doth ſet forth goodly,<note place="margin">Pſal. 103.</note> ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>As a Father hath compaſſion on his Children, ſo hath the Lord compaſſion on them that fear him, for he knoweth whereof we be made, he remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>breth that we are but duſt.</hi> Thirdly, He ſaith, <hi>that he is ſlow to anger,</hi> that is to ſay, <hi>long-ſuffering, and which is not lightly provoked to wrath.</hi> Fourthly, <hi>That he is of much kindneſs, for he is that bottom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs Well of all goodneſs, who rejoyceth to do good unto us; therefore did he create and make Men, that he might have whom he ſhould do good unto, and make partakers of his Heavenly Riches.</hi> Fifthly, <hi>He repenteth of the evil,</hi> that is to ſay, he doth call back again, and revoke the puniſhment which he had threatned, <hi>when he ſeeth Men repent, turn and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend.</hi>

And that they may give the better colour unto their peſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent and pernicious Error, they do commonly bring in the ſixth and tenth Chapters of the Epiſtle to the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> and the ſecond Chapter of the ſecond Epiſtle of <hi>Peter,</hi> not conſidering that in thoſe places the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Apoſtles do not ſpeak of the daily falls that we (as long as we carry about this body of ſin) are ſubject un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to;<note place="margin">Mat. 12.

But now mark what doth follow: After the ſame Holy Apoſtle had on Whitſunday,<note place="margin">Acts 2.</note> with the reſt of the Diſciples, received the gift of the Holy Ghoſt moſt abundantly, he committed no ſmall offence in <hi>Antiochia,</hi> by bringing the Conſciences of the Faithful into doubt by his Example,<note place="margin">Gal. 2.</note> ſo that <hi>Paul</hi> was fain to rebuke him to his Face, becauſe that he walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed not uprightly, or went not the right way in the Goſpel.

                     <p>HItherto have ye heard (Well-beloved,) how needful and neceſſary the Doctrin of Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance is, and how earneſtly it is throughout all the Scriptures of God, urged and ſet forth, both by the ancient Prophets, by our Saviour Jeſus Chriſt and his Apoſtles: And that for as much as it is the converſion or turning again of the whole Man unto God, from whom we go away by ſin; theſe four Points ought to be obſerved, that is, From whence, or from what things we muſt return? Unto whom this our returning muſt be made? By whoſe means it ought to be done that it may be effectual? And laſt of all, after what ſort we ought to behave our ſelves in the ſame, that it may be profitable unto us, and attain unto the thing that we do ſeek by it? Ye have alſo learned that as the Opinion of them that deny the benefit of Repentance unto thoſe, that after they be come to God and grafted in our Saviour Jeſus Chriſt, do through the frailneſs of their Fleſh, and the temptation of the Devil, fall into ſome grievous and deteſtable ſin, is moſt peſtilent and pernicious; ſo we muſt beware that we do in no wiſe think that we are able of our own ſelves, and of our own ſtrength, to return unto the Lord our God, from whom we are gone away by our wickedneſs and ſin. Now it ſhall be declared unto you, what be the true parts of Repentance, and what things ought to move us to repent, and to return unto the
<pb n="569" facs="tcp:54673:291" rendition="simple:additions"/> Lord our God with all ſpeed. Repentance (as it is ſaid before,) is a true rtturning unto God, whereby Men forſaking utterly their Idolatry and wickedneſs, do with a lively Faith embrace, love, and worſhip the true living God only, and give themſelves to all manner of good Works, which by Gods Word they know to be acceptable unto him.<note place="margin">There be four parts of Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance.</note> Now there be four parts of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, which being ſet together, may be likened to an eaſie and ſhort Ladder, whereby we may climb from the bottomleſs Pit of perdition, that we caſt our ſelves into by our daily offences and grievous ſins, up into the Caſtle or Tower of eternal and endleſs Salvation.</p>
                     <p>The firſt is the Contrition of the Heart; for we muſt be earneſtly ſorry for our ſins, and unfeignedly lament and bewail that we have by them ſo grievouſly offended our moſt bounteous and merciful God, who ſo tenderly loved us, that he gave his only begotten Son to die a moſt bitter death, and to ſhed his dear Heart Blood for our Redemption and Deliverance. And verily this inward ſorrow and grief being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived in the heart for the heinouſneſs of ſin, if it be earneſt and unfeigned, is a Sacrifice to God, as the holy Prophet <hi>David</hi> doth teſtifie, ſaying,<note place="margin">Pſalm 5.</note> 
                        <hi>A Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice to God is a troubled Spirit, a contrite and bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken Heart, O Lord, thou wilt not deſpiſe.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But that this may take place in us, we muſt be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent to read and hear the Scriptures and the Word of God, which moſt lively do paint out before our eyes our natural uncleanneſs, and the enormity of our ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful life.<note place="margin">2 Sam. 12</note> For unleſs we have a thorow feeling of our ſins, how can it be that we ſhould earneſtly be ſorry for them? Before <hi>David</hi> did hear the Word of the Lord by the mouth of the Prophet <hi>Nathan,</hi> what heavineſs I pray you was in him for the Adultery and the Murder that he had committed? So that it might be ſaid right well, that he ſlept in his own ſin. We read in the Acts of the Apoſtles,<note place="margin">Acts 4.</note> that when the People had heard the Sermon of <hi>Peter,</hi> they were compunct &amp; pricked in their hearts. Which thing
<pb n="570" facs="tcp:54673:292" rendition="simple:additions"/> would never have been, if they had not heard that wholeſom Sermon of <hi>Peter:</hi> They therefore that have no mind at all neither to read, nor yet to hear Gods Word, there is but ſmall hope of them, that they will as much as once ſet their Feet, or take hold upon the firſt Staff or Step of this Ladder, but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther will ſink deeper and deeper into the bottomleſs Pit of perdition. For if at any time through the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morſe of their Conſcience which accuſeth them, they feel any inward grief, ſorrow, or heavineſs for their ſins; for as much as they want the ſalve and comfort of Gods Word, which they do deſpiſe, it will be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them rather a Mean to bring them to utter deſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration than otherwiſe. The ſecond is an unfeigned Confeſſion and acknowledging of our ſins unto God, whom by them we have ſo grievouſly offended, that if he ſhould deal with us according to his juſtice, we do deſerve a thouſand Hells, if there could be ſo many. Yet if we will with a ſorrowful and contrite Heart,<note place="margin">Ezek. 18.</note> make an unfeigned Confeſſion of them unto God, he will freely and frankly forgive them, and ſo put all our wickedneſs out of remembrance before the ſight of his Majeſty, that they ſhall no more be thought upon. Hereunto doth pertain the golden ſaying of the holy Prophet <hi>David,</hi> where he ſaith on this manner, <hi>Then I acknowledge my ſin unto thee,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Pſalm 51.</note> 
                        <hi>neither did I hide mine iniquity: I ſaid, I will confeſs againſt my ſelf my wickedneſs unto the Lord, &amp; thou forgaveſt the ungod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs of my ſin.</hi> Theſe are alſo the words of <hi>John</hi> the Evangeliſt,<note place="margin">1 John 1.</note> 
                        <hi>If we confeſs our ſins, God is faithful and righteous to forgive us our ſins, and to make us clean from all our wickedneſs;</hi> which ought to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood of the Confeſſion which is made unto God. For theſe are St. <hi>Auguſtins</hi> words,<note place="margin">In Epiſt. ad Julian comitem <hi>30.</hi>
                        </note> 
                        <hi>That Confeſſion which is made unto God is required by Gods Law;</hi> whereof <hi>John</hi> the Apoſtle ſpeaketh, ſaying, <hi>If we confeſs our ſins, God is faithful and righteous to forgive us our ſins, and to make us clean from all our wickedneſs.</hi> For without this Confeſſion, ſin is not forgiven.
<pb n="571" facs="tcp:54673:292"/> This is then the chiefeſt and moſt principal Confeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that in the Scriptures and Word of God we are bidden to make, and without the which we ſhall ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver obtain pardon and forgiveneſs of our ſins. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, beſides this, there is another kind of Confeſſion which is needful and neceſſary.</p>
                     <p>And of the ſame doth St. <hi>James</hi> ſpeak after this manner, ſaying, <hi>Acknowledge your faults one to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother, and pray one for another, that ye may be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved;</hi> As if he ſhould ſay, Open that which grieveth you, that a Remedy may be found. And this is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded both for him that complaineth and for him that heareth, that the one ſhould ſhew his Grief to the other. The true meaning of it is, that the Faithful ought to acknowledge their offences, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by ſome hatred, rancour, ground or malice, having riſen or grown among them one to another, that a Brotherly reconciliation may be had, without the which nothing that we do can be acceptable unto God,<note place="margin">Mat. 5.</note> as our Saviour Jeſus Chriſt doth witneſs him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, ſaying, <hi>When thou offereſt thine Offering at the Altar, if thou remembreſt that thy Brother hath ought againſt thee, leave there thine Offering, and go and be reconciled, and when thou art reconciled, come and offer thine Offering.</hi> It may alſo be thus taken, that we ought to confeſs our weakneſs and infirmities one to another, to the end that knowing each others frail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, we may the more earneſtly pray together unto Almighty God our Heavenly Father, that he will vouchſafe to pardon us our infirmities, for his Son Jeſus Chriſts ſake, and not to impute them unto us, when he ſhall render to every Man according to his Works.<note place="margin">Anſwer to the Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries which maintain Auricular Confeſſion.</note> And whereas the Adverſaries go about to wreſt this place, for to maintain their Auricular Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion withal, they are greatly deceived themſelves, and do ſhamefully deceive others; for if this Text ought to be underſtood of Auricular Confeſſion, then the Prieſts are as much bound to confeſs themſelves unto the Lay-people, as the Lay-people are bound to confeſs
<pb n="572" facs="tcp:54673:293"/> themſelves to them. And if to Pray, is to Abſolve, then the Laity by this place hath as great Authority to Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve the Prieſts, as the Prieſts have to Abſolve the Laity. This did <hi>Johannes Scotus,</hi> otherwiſe called <hi>Duns,</hi> well perceive, who upon this place writeth on this manner,<note place="margin">Johannes Scotus lib. <hi>4.</hi> ſen. diſtinct. <hi>17</hi> quaeſt. <hi>1.</hi>
                        </note> 
                        <hi>Neither doth it ſeem unto me that</hi> James <hi>did give this commandment, or that he did ſet it forth as being received of Chriſt. For firſt and foremost, whence had he Authority to bind the whole Church, ſith that he was only Biſhop of the Church of</hi> Jeruſalem? <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept thou wilt ſay, that the ſame Church was at the beginning the Head Church, and conſequently that he was the Head Biſhop, which thing the See of</hi> Rome <hi>will never grant.</hi> The underſtanding of it then, is as in theſe words, <hi>Confeſs your ſins one to another.</hi> A perſuaſion to Hum lity, whereby he willeth us to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs our ſelves generally unto our Neighbors, that we are ſinners, according to this ſaying, <hi>If we ſay we have no ſin, we deceive our ſelves, and the truth is not in us.</hi> And where that they do alledge this ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of our Saviour Jeſus Chriſt unto the Leper, to prove Auricular Confeſſion to ſtand on Gods Word, <hi>Go thy way,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Mat. 8.</note> 
                        <hi>and ſhew thy ſelf unto the Prieſt.</hi> Do they not ſee that the Leper was cleanſed from his Leproſie, before he was by Chriſt ſent unto the Prieſt for to ſhew himſelf unto him? By the ſame reaſon we muſt be cleanſed from our Spiritual Leproſie, I mean, our ſins muſt be forgiven us before that we come to Confeſſion. What need we then to tell forth our ſins into the ear of the Prieſt, ſith that they be already taken away? Therefore holy <hi>Ambroſe</hi> in his ſecond Sermon upon the hundred and nineteenth <hi>Pſalm,</hi> doth ſay full well, <hi>Go ſhew thy ſelf unto the Prieſt.</hi> Who is the true Prieſt, but he which is the Prieſt for ever, after the order of <hi>Melchiſedech?</hi> whoreby this holy Father doth under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand, that both the Prieſthood &amp; the Law being chang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, we ought to acknowledge none other Prieſt for deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance from our ſins; but our Saviour Jeſus Chriſt, who being Sovereign Biſhop, doth with the Sacrifice of his
<pb n="573" facs="tcp:54673:293"/> Body and Blood, offered once for ever upon the Altar of the Croſs, moſt effectually cleanſe the Spiritual Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proſie, and waſh away the Sins of thoſe that with true confeſſion of the ſame do flee unto him. It is moſt evident and plain, that this Auricular Confeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, hath not his warrant of Gods Word,<note place="margin">Nectarius. Sozomen. Eccleſ. Hiſt. lib. <hi>7.</hi> cap. <hi>16.</hi> lib. <hi>10.</hi> confeſſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num. cap. <hi>3.</hi>

For then any thing ordained of God, is by the lewdneſs of Men abuſed, the abuſe ought to be taken away, and the thing it ſelf ſuffered to remain.

Being therefore not led with the Conſcience thereof, let us with fear and trembling, and with a true contrite Heart, uſe that kind of Confeſſion, that God doth command in his Word, and then doubtleſs, as he is Faithful and Righteous, he will forgive us our Sins, and make us clean from all wickedneſs. I do not ſay, but that if any do find themſelves troubled in Conſcience, they may repair to their Learned Curate or Paſtor, or to ſome other Godly Learned Man, and ſhew the trouble and doubt of their Conſcience to them, that they may receive at their hand the comfortable Salve of Gods Word: but it is againſt the true Chriſtian liberty, that any Man ſhould be bound to the numbring of his Sins, as it hath been uſed heretofore in the time of blindneſs and ignorance.</p>

                     <p>The Third prrt of Repentance, is Faith, whereby we do apprehend and take hold upon the promiſes of God, touching the free Pardon and Forgiveneſs of our ſins. Which promiſes are Sealed up unto us, with the Death and Blood-ſhedding of his Son Jeſus Chriſt. For what ſhould avail and profit us to be ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry for our Sins, to lament and bewail that we have offended our moſt Bounteous and Merciful Father, or to confeſs and acknowledge our Offences and Treſpaſſes, though it be done never ſo earneſtly, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs we do ſtedfaſtly believe, and be fully perſwaded, that God for his Son Jeſus Chriſts ſake, will Forgive us all our Sins, and put them out of Remembrance, and from his ſight? Therefore they that teach Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance without a lively Faith in our Saviour Jeſus Chriſt, do teach none other but <hi>Judas</hi> Repentance, as all the School-men do,<note place="margin">The Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance of the School-men. <hi>Judas</hi> and his Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance. <hi>Matt. 27.</hi>

Did not he alſo before he Hanged himſelf, make an open Confeſſion of his fault, when he ſaid, <hi>I have ſinned, betraying the Innocent Blood?</hi> and ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily this was a very bold Confeſſion, which might have brought him to great trouble. For by it he did lay to the High Prieſt and Elders charge, the ſhedding of Innocent Blood, and that they were moſt Abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable Murderers. He did alſo make a certain kind of ſatisfaction, when he did caſt their Mony unto them again. No ſuch things do we read of <hi>Peter,</hi> although he had committed a very heinous ſin, and moſt grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous offence,<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Peter</hi> and his Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance.</note> in denying his of Maſter. We find that <hi>he went out and wept bitterly,</hi> whereof <hi>Ambroſe</hi>
                        <pb n="575" facs="tcp:54673:294" rendition="simple:additions"/> ſpeaketh on this manner; Peter <hi>was ſorry and wept,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">De poeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentia di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtin. <hi>I.</hi> cap. Petrus.</note> 
                        <hi>becauſe he erred as a Man.</hi> I do not find what he ſaid, I know that he wept: I read of his Tears, but not of his ſatisfaction. But how chance that the one was received into favor again with God, and the other caſt away, but becauſe that the one did, by a lively Faith in him whom he had denied, take hold upon the mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of God, and the other wanted Faith, whereby he did deſpair of the Goodneſs and Mercy of God? It is evident and plain then, that although we be never ſo earneſtly ſorry for our ſins, acknowledge and confeſs them; yet all theſe things ſhall be but means to bring us to utter deſparation, except we do ſtedfaſtly believe, that God our Heavenly Father will for his Son Jeſus Chriſts ſake, Pardon and Forgive us our Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fences and Treſpaſſes, and utterly put them out of remembrance in his ſight. Therefore as we ſaid be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, they that teach Repentance without Chriſt, and a lively Faith in the Mercy of God, do only teach <hi>Cains</hi> or <hi>Judas</hi> Repentance. The Fourth is, an Amendment of Life, or a new Life, in bringing forth Fruits worthy of Repentance. For they that do truly Repent, muſt be clean altered and changed, they muſt become new Creatures, they muſt be no more the ſame that that they were before. And therefore thus ſaid <hi>John</hi> Baptiſt unto the <hi>Phariſees</hi> and <hi>Sadducees</hi> that came unto his Baptiſm: <hi>O generation of Vipers,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Matt. 3.</note> 
                        <hi>who hath fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warned you to flee from the anger to come? bring forth therefore Fruits worthy of Repentance.</hi> Whereby we do learn, that if we will have the wrath of God to be pacified, we muſt in no wiſe diſſemble, but turn unto him again with a true and found Repentance, which may be known and declared by good Fruits, as by moſt ſure and infallible ſigns thereof.</p>
                     <p>They that do from the bottom of their Hearts ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge their Sins, and are unfeignedly ſorry for their Offences, will caſt off all Hypocriſie, and put on true Humility, and lowlineſs of Heart. They will not only receive the Phyſician of the Soul, but alſo with a
<pb n="576" facs="tcp:54673:295"/> moſt fervent deſire long for him. They will not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly abſtain from the Sins of their former Life, and from all other filthy Vices, but alſo flee, eſchew, and abhor all the occaſions of them. And as they did be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore give themſelves to uncleanneſs of Life, ſo will they from henceforwards with all diligence give them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to Innocency, pureneſs of Life, and true God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs.<note place="margin">Ionas 3.</note> We have the <hi>Ninevites</hi> for an example, which at the Preaching of <hi>Jonas</hi> did not only pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claim a general Faſt, and that they ſhould every one put on Sackcloth; but they all did turn from their Evil Ways, and from the Wickedneſs that was in their Hands. But above all other, the Hiſtory of <hi>Zaccheus</hi> is moſt notable; For being come unto our Saviour Jeſus Chriſt,<note place="margin">Luke 19.</note> he did ſay, <hi>Behold Lord, the half of my Goods I give to the Poor; and if I have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frauded any Man, or taken ought away by Extortion or Fraud, I do restore him fourfold.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Here we ſee that after his Repentance, he was no more the Man that he was before, but was clean chang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and altered. It was ſo far off, that he would con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue and abide ſtill in his unſatiable covetouſneſs, or take ought away fraudulently from any Man, that rather he was moſt willing and ready to give away his own, and to make ſatisfaction unto all them that he had done injury and wrong unto. Here may we right well add the ſinful Woman, which when ſhe came to our Saviour Jeſus Chriſt,<note place="margin">Luke 7.</note> did pour down ſuch a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundance of Tears out of thoſe wanton Eyes of hers, wherewith ſhe had allured many unto folly, that ſhe did with them waſh his Feet, wiping them with the Hairs of her Head, which ſhe was wont moſt glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly to ſet out, making of them a Net for the Devil. Hereby we do learn, what is the ſatisfaction that God doth require of us, which is, that we ceaſe from Evil,<note place="margin">Iohn 5.</note> and do Good; and if we have done any Man wrong, to endeavor our ſelves to make him true a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mends to the utmoſt of our power, following in this the example of <hi>Zaccheus,</hi> and of this ſinfull Woman, and
<pb n="577" facs="tcp:54673:295"/> alſo that goodly Leſſon that <hi>John</hi> Baptiſt, <hi>Zacharias</hi> Son, bid give unto them that came to ask Counſel of him. This was commonly the Penance that Chriſt enjoyned ſinners, <hi>Go thy way and ſin no more.</hi>
                        <note place="margin">John 15.</note> Which Penance we ſhall never be able to fulfil without the ſpecial grace of him that doth ſay, <hi>Without me ye can do nothing.</hi> It is therefore our parts, if at leaſt we be deſirous of the health and ſalvation of our own ſelves, moſt earneſtly to pray unto our heavenly Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, to aſſiſt us with his holy Spirit, that we may be able to hearken unto the Voice of the true Shepherd, and with due obedience to follow the ſame.</p>
                     <p>Let us hearken to the Voice of Almighty God, when he calleth us to Repentance, let us not harden our hearts as ſuch Infidels do, who abuſe the time given them of God to repent, and turn it to continue their pride and contempt againſt God and Man, which know not how much they heap Gods wrath upon themſelves, for the hardneſs of their hearts, which cannot repent at the day of Vengeance. Where we have offended the Law of God, let us repent us of our ſtraying from ſo good a Lord. Let us confeſs our un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthineſs before him, but yet let us truſt in Gods free mercy, for Chriſts ſake, for the pardon of the ſame. And from henceforth let us endeavor our ſelves to walk in a new Life as new born Babes, whereby we may glorifie our Father which is in Heaven, and thereby to bear in our Conſciences a good teſtimony of our Faith; ſo that at the laſt to obtain the fruition of everlaſting life, through the merits of our Saviour; To whom be all praiſe and honor for ever. <hi>Amen.</hi>

                     <p>IN the Homily laſt ſpoken unto you (right well-be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved People, in our Saviour Chriſt) ye heard of the true parts and tokens of Repentance; that is,
<pb n="578" facs="tcp:54673:296"/> hearty contrition and ſorrowfulneſs of our Hearts, unfeigned confeſſion in word of mouth for our un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy living before God, a ſtedfaſt Faith to the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits of our Saviour Chriſt for pardon, and a purpoſe of our ſelves by Gods grace to renounce our former wicked life, and a full Converſion to God in a new life, to glorifie his Name, and to live orderly and charitably, to the comfort of our Neighbor, in all righteouſneſs, and to live ſoberly and modeſtly to our ſelves, by uſing abſtinence and temperance in word and in deed, in mortifying our earthly Members here upon Earth. Now for a further perſwaſion to move you to thoſe parts of Repentance, I will declare un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to you ſome cauſes, which ſhould the rather move you to Repentance.</p>
                     <p>
                        <note place="margin">The cauſes that ſhould move us to Repent. <hi>Eſay 31. Ezek. 33. Hoſ. 14.</hi>
                        </note>Firſt, The Commandment of God (who in ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny places of the holy and ſacred Scriptures) doth bid us return unto him. <hi>O ye Children of</hi> Iſrael (ſaith he) <hi>turn again from your infidelity, wherein ye drown<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed your ſelves.</hi> Again, <hi>Turn you, turn you from your evil ways; For why will ye die, O ye Houſe of</hi> Iſrael? And in another place, thus doth he ſpeak by his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet <hi>Hoſea,</hi> O Iſrael, <hi>return unto the Lord thy God; For thou haſt taken a great fall by thine iniquity.</hi> Take unto you theſe words with you, when you turn unto the Lord and ſay unto him, <hi>Take away all ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity, and receive us graciouſly, ſo will we offer the Calves of our Lips unto thee.</hi> In all theſe places we have an expreſs commandment given unto us of God, for to return unto him. Therefore we muſt take good heed unto our ſelves, leſt whereas we have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready by our manifold ſins and tranſgreſſions provok<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and kindled the wrath of God againſt us; we do by breaking this his Commandment, double our of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fences, and ſo heap ſtill damnation upon our own heads by our daily offences and treſpaſſes, whereby we provoke the eyes of his Majeſty, we do well de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve (if he ſhould deal with us according to his ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice,) to be put away for ever from the fruition of his
<pb n="579" facs="tcp:54673:296"/> Glory. How much more then are we worthy of the endleſs torments of Hell, if when we be ſo gently cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led again after our Rebellion, and commanded to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn, we will in no wiſe hearken unto the voice of our heavenly Father, but walk ſtill after the ſtubbornneſs of our own hearts?</p>
                     <p>Secondly, The moſt comfortable and ſweet pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe that the Lord our God did of his meer mercy and goodneſs joyn unto his Commandment; for he doth not only ſay, <hi>Return unto me, O Iſrael;</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Jer. 4.</note> 
                        <hi>but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo, if thou wilt return, and put away all thine abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minations out of my ſight, thou ſhalt never be mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved.</hi> Theſe words alſo have we in the Prophet <hi>Eze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kiel,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Ezek. 18.</note> 
                        <hi>At what time ſoever a ſinner doth repent him of his ſin, from the bottom of his heart, I will put all his wickedneſs out of my remembrance,</hi> (ſaith the Lord,) <hi>ſo that they ſhall be no more thought upon.</hi> Thus are we ſufficiently inſtructed, that God will according to his promiſe, freely pardon, forgive, and forget all our ſins, ſo that we ſhall never be caſt in the teeth with them; if obeying his Commadment, and allured by his ſweet Promiſes, we will unfeign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly return unto him.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, The filthineſs of ſin, which is ſuch, that as long as we do abide in it, God cannot but deteſt and abhor us, neither can there be any hope that we ſhall enter into the Heavenly <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> except we be firſt made clean and purged from it. But this will never be, unleſs forſaking our former life, we do with our whole heart return unto the Lord our God, and with a full purpoſe of amendment of life, flee unto his mercy, taking ſure hold thereupon through Faith in the Blood of his Son Jeſus Chriſt. If we ſhould ſuſpect any uncleanneſs to be in us,<note place="margin">Similitude</note> wherefore the earthly Prince ſhould loath and ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hor the ſight of us, what pains would we take to remove and put it away? How much more ought we with all diligence and ſpeed that may be, to put away that unclean filthineſs that doth ſeparate and
<pb n="580" facs="tcp:54673:297"/> make a diviſion betwixt us and our God,<note place="margin">Eſay 59.</note> and that hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth his Face from us, that he will not hear us? And verily herein doth appear how filthy a thing ſin is, ſith than it can by no other means be waſhed away, but by the Blood of the only begotten Son of God. And ſhall we not from the bottom of our hearts deteſt and abhor, and with all earneſtneſs flee from it, ſith that it did coſt the dear Heart-Blood of the only begotten Son of God our Saviour and Redeemer, to purge us from it? <hi>Plato</hi> doth in a certain place write, that if Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue could be ſeen with bodily Eyes, all Men would wonderfully be inflamed and kindled with the love of it; even ſo on the contrary, if we might with our bodily Eyes behold the filthineſs of ſin, and the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleanneſs thereof, we could in no wiſe abide it, but as moſt preſent and deadly Poiſon hate and eſchew it. We have a common Experience of the ſame in them, which when they have committed any hein<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous offence, or ſome filthy and abominable ſin, if it once come to light, or if they chance to have a through feeling of it, they be ſo aſhamed (their own Conſcience putting before their Eyes the fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thineſs of their Act,) that they dare look no Man in the Face, much leſs that they ſhould be able to ſtand in the ſight of God.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, The uncertainty and brittleneſs of our own lives, which is ſuch, that we cannot aſſure our ſelves that we ſhall live one hour, or one half quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of it. Which by experience we do find daily to be true, in them that being now merry and luſty, and ſometimes Feaſting and Banqueting with their Friends, do fall ſuddenly dead in the Streets, and otherwhiles under the Board when they are at meat. Theſe daily Examples, as they are moſt terrible and dreadful, ſo ought they to move us to ſeek for to be at one with our heavenly Judge, that we may with a good Conſcience appear before him, whenſoever it ſhall pleaſe him for to call us, whether it be ſudden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly or otherwiſe; for we have no more Charter
<pb n="581" facs="tcp:54673:297"/> of our life than they have. But as we are moſt cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain that we ſhall die, ſo are we moſt uncertain when we ſhall die. For our life doth lie in the hand of God, who will take it away when it pleaſeth him. And verily when the higheſt Summer of all,<note place="margin">Death, the Lords Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner. <hi>Eccleſ. 11.</hi> Contra Demetri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anum. <hi>Eccleſ. 5.</hi>
                        </note> which is death, ſhall come, he will not be ſaid nay; but we muſt be forthwith be packing, to be preſent before the Judgment ſeat of God, as he doth find us, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as it is written, <hi>Whereas the Tree falleth, whether it be toward the South or toward the North, there it ſhall lie.</hi> Whereunto agreeth the ſaying of the holy Martyr of God St. <hi>Cyprian,</hi> ſaying, <hi>As God doth find thee when he doth call, ſo doth he judge thee.</hi> Let us therefore follow the Counſel of the Wiſe Man, where he ſaith, <hi>Make no tarrying to turn unto the Lord, and put not off from day to day. For ſuddenly ſhall the wrath of the Lord break forth, and in thy ſecurity ſhalt thou be deſtroyed, and ſhalt periſh in the time of Vengeance.</hi> Which words I deſire you to mark diligently, becauſe they do moſt lively put before our Eyes the fondneſs of many Men, who a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſing the long-ſuffering and goodneſs of God, do never think on Repentance or amendment of Life. <hi>Follow not</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>thine own mind, and thy ſtrength, to walk in the ways of thy heart;</hi> neither ſay thou, <hi>Who will bring me under for my works? For God the Revenger, will revenge the wrong done by thee.</hi> And ſay not, <hi>I have ſinned, and what evil hath come un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to me? For the Almighty is a patient Rewarder, but he will not leave thee unpuniſhed. Becauſe thy ſins are forgiven thee, be not without fear to heap ſin up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſin.</hi> Say not neither, <hi>The mercy of God is great, he will forgive my manifold ſins. For mercy and wrath come from him, and his indignation cometh upon un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>repentant ſinners.</hi> As if ye ſhould ſay, <hi>Art thou ſtrong and mighty? Art thou luſty and young? Haſt thou the Wealth and Riches of the World? Or when thou haſt ſinned, haſt thou received no puniſhment for it?</hi> Let none of all theſe things make thee
<pb n="582" facs="tcp:54673:298"/> to be the ſlower to repent, and to return with ſpeed unto the Lord. For in the day of puniſhment and of his ſudden vengeance, they ſhall not be able to help thee. And ſpecially, when thou art either by the Preaching of Gods Word, or by ſome inward motion of his holy Spirit, or elſe by ſome other means called unto Repentance, neglect not the good occaſion that is miniſtred unto thee, leſt when thou wouldſt repent, thou haſt not the grace for to do it. For to repent is a good gift of God, which he will never grant unto them, who living in carnal ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, do make a mock of his Threatnings, or ſeek to rule his Spirit as they liſt, as though his work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and gifts were tied unto their will.</p>
                     <p>Fifthly, The avoiding of the plagues of God, and the utter deſtruction that by his righteous Judgment doth hang over the heads of them all that will in no wiſe return unto the Lord:<note place="margin">Jer. 24.</note> 
                        <hi>I will</hi> (ſaith the Lord) <hi>give them for a terrible plague to all the Kingdoms of the Earth, and for a Reproach, and for a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verb, and for a Curſe in all places where I ſhall caſt them, and will ſend the Sword of Famine and the Peſtilence among them, till they be conſumed out of the Land.</hi> And wherefore is this? Becauſe they hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned their hearts, and would in no wiſe return from their evil ways, nor yet forſake the wickedneſs that was in their own hands, that the fierceneſs of the Lords fury might depart from them.<note place="margin">Rom. 8.</note> But yet this is nothing in compariſon of the intolerable and end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs torments of Hell fire, which they ſhall be fain to ſuffer, who after their hardneſs of heart that cannot repent, do heap unto themſelves Wrath againſt the day of anger, and of the declaration of the juſt Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of God: Whereas, if we will repent, and be earneſtly ſorry for our ſin, and with a full purpoſe and amendment of Life, flee unto the mercy of our God, and taking ſure hold thereupon through Faith in our Saviour Jeſus Chriſt, do bring forth Fruits worthy of Repentance; he will not only pour
<pb n="583" facs="tcp:54673:298"/> his manifold Bleſſings upon us here in this World, but alſo at the laſt, after the painful Travels of this Life, reward us with the inheritance of his Children, which is the Kingdom of Heaven, pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſed unto us with the death of his Son Jeſus Chriſt our Lord; To whom with the Father and the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ghoſt, be all praiſe, glory and honor, World without end. <hi>Amen.</hi>

Whoſoever therefore reſiſteth the Power, reſiſteth the Ordinance of God, and they that reſiſt ſhall receive to themſelves damnation. For Princes are not to be feared for good Works, but for evil. Wilt thou then be without fear of the Power? Do well, ſo ſhalt thou have praiſe of the ſame; for he is the Miniſter of God for thy Wealth: But if thou do evil, fear; for he beareth not the Sword for nought, for he is the Miniſter of God, to take vengeance upon him that doth evil. Wherefore ye muſt be ſubject, not becauſe of Wrath only, but alſo for Conſcience ſake; for, for this cauſe ye pay alſo tribute; for they are Gods Miniſters, ſerving for the ſame purpoſe. Give to every Man therefore his due; tribute to whom tribute belongeth, cuſtom to whom cuſtom is due, fear to whom fear belongeth, honor to whom ye owe honor.</q> Thus far are S. <hi>Pauls</hi> words.

For ſo is the Will of God, that with well doing ye may ſtop the mouths of ignorant and fooliſh Men, as free, and not as having the liberty for a cloak of maliciouſneſs, but even as the Servants of God.

                     <p>What ſhall Subjects do then? ſhall they obey Vali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant, Stout, Wiſe, and Good Princes, and Contemn, Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obey, and Rebel againſt Children being their Princes, or againſt undiſcreet and evil Governors? God forbid: For Firſt, What a perilous thing were it to commit unto the Subjects the Judgment, which Prince is Wiſe and Godly, and his Government good, and which is otherwiſe; as though the Foot muſt judge of the Head; an enterpriſe very heinous, and muſt needs breed Rebellion. For who elſe be they that are moſt enclin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to Rebellion, but ſuch haughty Spirits? From whom ſpringeth ſuch foul ruin of Realms? Is not Rebelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the greateſt of all Miſchiefs? And who are moſt rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to the greateſt of Miſchiefs, but the worſt Men? Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bels therefore the worſt of all Subjects are moſt ready to Rebellion, as being the worſt of all Vices, and far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theſt
<pb n="590" facs="tcp:54673:302"/> from the duty of a good Subject, as on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary part, the beſt Subjects are moſt firm and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant in obedience, as in the ſpecial and peculiar ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of good Subjects. What an unworthy matter were it then, to make the naughtieſt Subjects (and moſt inclined to Rebellion and all evil,) Judges over their Princes, over their Government, and over their Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſellors, to determin which of them be good or tolera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and which be evil and ſo intolerable, that they muſt needs be removed by Rebels, being ever ready as the naughtieſt Subjects, ſooneſt to Rebel againſt the beſt Princes, ſpecially if they be young in Age, Women in Sex, or gentle and courteous in Government; as truſting by their wicked boldneſs, eaſily to overthrow their weakneſs and gentleneſs, or at the leaſt ſo to fear the minds of ſuch Princes, that they may have impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of their miſchievous doings.</p>
                     <p>But whereas, indeed a Rebel is worſe than the worſt Prince, and Rebellion worſe than the worſt Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the worſt Prince that hitherto hath been; both Rebels are unmeet Miniſters, and Rebellion an unfit and unwholſom Medicine to reform any ſmall lacks in a Prince, or to cure any little griefs in Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment; ſuch lewd Remedies being far worſe than any other maladies and diſorders that can be in the Body of a Common-wealth. But whatſoever the Prince be or his Government, it is evident, that for the moſt part thoſe Princes whom ſome Subjects do think to be very godly, and under whoſe Government they rejoyce to live; ſome other Subjects do take the ſame to be evil and ungodly, and do wiſh for a change. If therefore all Subjects that miſlike of their Prince ſhould Rebel, no Realm ſhould ever be without Rebellion. It were more meet that Rebels ſhould hear the advice of wiſe Men, and give place unto their Judgment, and follow the example of obedient Subjects; as reaſon is, that they whoſe underſtanding is blinded with ſo evil an affection, ſhould give place to them that be of ſound judgment, and that the worſt ſhould give place to

But what if the Prince be undiſcreet, and evil indeed, and is alſo e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vident to all Mens eyes, that he ſo is? I ask again, What if it be long of the wickedneſs of the Subjects, that the Prince is undiſcreet and evil; Shall the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects both by their wickedneſs provoke God for their deſerved puniſhment, to give them an undiſcreet or evil Prince, and alſo rebel againſt him, and withal a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt God, who for the puniſhment of their ſins did give them ſuch a Prince? Will you hear the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures concerning this Point?<note place="margin">Job 34.10. Hoſ. 13.6.</note>

                     <head>The Second Part of the Homily againſt Diſobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience and Wilful Rebellion.</head>
                     <p>AS in the Firſt Part of this Treaty of Obedience of Subjects to their Princes, and againſt Diſobedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence and Rebellion, I have alledged divers ſentences out of the holy Scriptures for proof; ſo ſhall it be good for the better declaration and confirmation of the ſaid wholſom Doctrin, to alledge one example or two out of the holy Scriptures of the Obedience of Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, not only unto their good and gracious Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernors, but alſo unto their evil and unkind Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces. As King <hi>Saul</hi> was not of the beſt, but rather of the worſt ſort of Princes, as being out of Gods favor for his diſobedience againſt God in ſparing (in a wrong pity) the King <hi>Agag,</hi> whom Almighty God commanded to be ſlain, according to the Juſtice of God againſt his ſworn Enemy; and although <hi>Saul</hi> of a Devotion meant to Sacrifice ſuch things as he ſpared of the <hi>Amalechites</hi> to the Honor and Service of God; yet <hi>Saul</hi> was reproved for his wrong Mercy and Devotion, and was told, that Obedience would have more pleaſed him than ſuch lenity, which ſinful humanity (ſaith holy <hi>Chryſoſtom</hi>) is more cruel be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God, than any Murther or ſhedding of Blood
<pb n="598" facs="tcp:54673:306"/> when it is commanded of God. But yet how evil ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever <hi>Saul</hi> the King was, and out of Gods favor, yet was he obeyed of his Subject <hi>David,</hi> the very beſt of all Subjects, and moſt valiant in the ſervice of his Prince and Country in the Wars, the moſt obedient and loving in Peace, and always moſt true and faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to his Sovereign and Lord, and fartheſt off from all manner of Rebellion. For the which his moſt pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, true and faithful Service, King <hi>Saul</hi> yet reward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him not only with great unkindneſs, but alſo ſought his deſtruction and death by all means poſſible; ſo that <hi>David</hi> was fain to ſave his life, not by Rebellion or any Reſiſtance, but by flight, and hiding himſelf from the Kings ſight. Which notwithſtanding, when King <hi>Saul</hi> upon a time came alone into the Cave where <hi>David</hi> was, ſo that <hi>David</hi> might eaſily have ſlain him, yet would he neither hurt him him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, neither ſuffer any of his Men to lay hands upon him. Another time alſo <hi>David</hi> entring by night with one <hi>Abiſai,</hi> a valiant and fierce Man, into the Tent where King <hi>Saul</hi> did lie aſleep, where alſo he might yet more eaſily have ſlain him, yet would he neither hurt him himſelf nor ſuffer <hi>Abiſai</hi> (who was willing and ready to ſlay King <hi>Saul,</hi>) once to touch him. Thus did <hi>David</hi> deal with <hi>Saul</hi> his Prince, notwithſtanding that King <hi>Saul</hi> continually ſaught his death and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction. It ſhall not be amiſs unto theſe Deeds of <hi>David,</hi> to add his words, and to ſhew you what he ſpake unto ſuch as encouraged him to take his opportunity and advantage to ſlay King <hi>Saul</hi> as his mortal Enemy, when he might.<note place="margin">1 Reg. 24. b. 7, &amp;c. 1 Reg. 26. b. 9. &amp; b. 10, &amp;c.</note> 
                        <hi>The Lord keep me</hi> (ſaith <hi>David,) from doing that thing, and from laying hands upon my Lord, Gods Anointed. For who can lay his hand upon the Lords Anointed and be guiltleſs? As truly as the Lord liveth, except that the Lord do ſmite him, or his days ſhall come to die, or that he go down to War, and be ſlain in Battel; the Lord be merciful unto me, that I lay not my hand upon the Lords Anointed.</hi>

Neither is it to be omitted and left out, how, when an <hi>Amalechite</hi> had ſlain King <hi>Saul,</hi> even at <hi>Sauls</hi> own bidding and commandment; (for he would live no longer now, for that he had loſt the Field againſt his Enemies the <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſtines,</hi>) the ſaid <hi>Amalechite</hi> making great haſt to bring firſt word and news thereof unto <hi>David,</hi> as joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous unto him for the death of his mortal Enemy, bringing withal the Crown that was upon King <hi>Sauls</hi> head, and the Bracelet that was about his arm, both as a proof of the truth of his news, and alſo as fit and pleaſant Preſents unto <hi>David,</hi> being by God ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed to be King <hi>Saul</hi> his Succeſſor in the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom;<note place="margin">2 Reg. 1. c. 12.</note> yet was that faithful and godly <hi>David</hi> ſo far from rejoycing at theſe news, that he rent his Cloaths, Wept and Mourned, and Faſted; and ſo far off from thankſgiving to the Meſſenger, either for his deed in killing the King, though his deadly Enemy, or for his Meſſage and News, or for his Preſents that he brought, that he ſaid unto him, <q>How hapned it that thou waſt not afraid to lay thy hands upon the Lords Anointed, to ſlay him? Whereupon,<note place="margin">2 Reg. 1. c. 4. c. 15.</note> immediately he commanded one of his Servants to kill the Meſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, and ſaid, Thy Blood be upon thine own head, for thine own mouth hath witneſſed againſt thy ſelf in confeſſing that thou haſt ſlain the Lords Anointed.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>This Example, dearly beloved, is notable, and the Circumſtances thereof are well to be conſidered, for the better inſtruction of all Subjects in their bounden Duty of Obedience, and perpetual fearing of them from attempting of any Rebellion or hurt againſt their Prince. On the one part, <hi>David</hi> was not only a good and true Subject, but alſo ſuch a Subject as both in Peace and War had ſerved and ſaved his Princes ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor and life, and delivered his Countrey and Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey-men from great danger of Infidels, Foreign and moſt cruel Enemies, horribly invading the King

And which is moſt of all, <hi>David</hi> was highly and ſingular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in the favor of God: On the contrary part King <hi>Saul</hi> was out of Gods favor (for that cauſe which is before rehearſed) and he as it were Gods Enemy, and therefore like in War and Peace to be hurtful and pernicious unto the Commonwealth, and that was known to many of his Subjects, for that he was openly rebuked of <hi>Samuel</hi> for his diſobedience unto God, which might make the People the leſs to eſteem him.<note place="margin">1 Reg. 15. &amp; 22. &amp; 26.</note> King <hi>Saul</hi> was alſo unto <hi>David</hi> a mortal and deadly Enemy, though without <hi>Davids</hi> deſerving, who by his faithful, painful, profitable, yea, moſt ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary Service, had well deſerved, as of his Country, ſo of his Prince; but King <hi>Saul</hi> far otherwiſe; the more was his unkindneſs, hatred, and cruelty towards ſuch a good Subject, both odious and deteſtable. Yet would <hi>David</hi> neither himſelf ſlay nor hurt ſuch an Enemy, for that he was his Prince and Lord, nor would ſuffer any other to kill, hurt, or lay hand upon him, when he might have been ſlain without any ſtir, tumult, or danger of any Mans life: Now let <hi>David</hi> anſwer to ſuch demands, as Men deſirous of Rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion, do uſe to make.

                     <p>Thus would godly <hi>David</hi> make anſwer; and St. <hi>Paul,</hi> as ye heard before, willeth us alſo to pray for ſuch a Prince. If King <hi>David</hi> would make theſe Anſwers, as by his deeds and words recorded in the Holy Scriptures, indeed he doth make unto all ſuch Demands concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing rebelling againſt evil Princes, unkind Princes, cruel Princes, Princes that be to their good Subjects mortal Enemies, Princes that are out of Gods favor, and ſo hurtful or like to be hurtful to the Common-wealth: What Anſwer think you would he make to thoſe that demand,<note place="margin">An unna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural and wicked Queſtion.</note> whether they (being naughty and unkind Subjects,) may not, to the great hazard of the life of many thouſands, and the utter danger of the State of the Common-wealth, and the whole Realm aſſemble a ſort of Rebels, either to depoſe, to put in fear, or to deſtroy their natural and loving Princes, enemy to none, good to all, even to them, the worſt of all other, the maintainer of perpetual Peace, Quietneſs and Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity, moſt beneficial to the Common-Wealth, moſt neceſſary for the ſafeguard of the whole Realm? What anſwer would <hi>David</hi> make to their Demand, whether they may not attempt cruelly and unnatural<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to deſtroy ſo peaceable and merciful a Prince? What (I ſay,) would <hi>David,</hi> ſo reverently ſpeaking of <hi>Saul,</hi> and ſo patiently ſuffering ſo evil a King, what would he anſwer and ſay to ſuch Demands? What would he ſay? nay, what would he do to ſuch high Attempters, who ſo ſaid and did as you before have heard, unto him that ſlew the King his Maſter, though a moſt wicked Prince? If he puniſhed with death as a wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed doer ſuch a Man, with what reproaches of words would he revile ſuch, yea, with what torments of moſt ſhameful deaths would he deſtroy ſuch Hell-hounds rather than evil Men, ſuch Rebels, I mean, as I laſt ſpoke of? For if they who do diſobey an evil and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind Prince, be moſt unlike unto <hi>David,</hi> that good Subject: What be they who do rebel againſt a moſt natural and loving Prince? And if <hi>David</hi> being ſo good a Subject that he obeyed ſo evil a King, was wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy

Surely, no mortal Man can expreſs with words, nor conceive in mind the horrible and moſt dreadful damnation that ſuch be worthy of, who diſdaining to be the quiet and happy Subjects of their good Prince, are moſt worthy to be the miſerable Captives, and vile Slaves of that infernal Tyrant Satan, and with him to ſuffer eternal ſlavery and torments.

This Obedience

But no Example ought to be of more force with us Chriſtians, than the example of Chriſt our Maſter and Saviour, who though he were the Son of God, yet did always behave himſelf moſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verently to ſuch Men as were in Authority in the World in his time; and he not rebelliouſly behaved him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, but openly did teach the Jews to pay tribute un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the <hi>Roman</hi> Emperor, though a Foreign and a Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan Prince, yea, himſelf with his Apoſtles paid tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute unto him: And finally, being brought before <hi>Pontius Pilate,</hi> a ſtranger born, and an Heathen Man, being Lord Preſident of <hi>Jury,</hi> he acknowledged his Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority and Power to be given him from God, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beyed patiently the ſentence of moſt painful and ſhameful Death, which the ſaid Judge pronounced and gave moſt unjuſtly againſt him, without any grudge, murmuring, or evil word once giving.</p>
                     <p>There be many and divers other examples of the obedience to Princes, even ſuch as be evil, in the New Teſtament, to the utter confuſion of diſobedient and rebellious People; but this one may be an eternal Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, which the Son of God, and ſo the Lord of all, Jeſus Chriſt hath given to us his Chriſtians and Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, and ſuch as may ſerve for all, to teach us to obey Princes, though ſtrangers, wicked and wrongful, when God for our ſins ſhall place ſuch over us.

                     <head>The Third Part of the Homily againſt Diſobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience and Wilful Rebellion.</head>
                     <p>AS I have in the Firſt Part of this Treatiſe ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed unto you the Doctrin of the Holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, as concerning the Obedience of true Subjects to their Princes, even as well to ſuch as be e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil, as unto the good; and in the Second Part of the ſame Treaty, confirmed the ſame Doctrin by notable examples, likewiſe taken out of the Holy Scriptures; ſo remaineth it now, that I partly do declare unto you
<pb n="607" facs="tcp:54673:310"/> in this Third Part, what an abominable ſin againſt God and Man Rebellion is, and how dreadfully the wrath of God is kindled and inflamed againſt all Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bels, and what horrible plagues, puniſhments and deaths, and finally, eternal damnation doth hang o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver their heads; as how on the contrary part, good and obedient Subjects are in Gods favor, and be par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takers of Peace, Quietneſs and Security, with other Gods manifold bleſſings in this World, and by his mercies through our Saviour Chriſt, of life everlaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing alſo in the World to come. How horrible a ſin againſt God and Man Rebellion is, cannot poſſibly be expreſſed according unto the greatneſs thereof. For he that nameth Rebellion, nameth not a ſingular or one only ſin, as is Theft, Robbery, Murder, and ſuch like; but he nameth the whole puddle and ſink of all ſins a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt God and Man, againſt his Prince, his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, his Country-men, his Parents, his Children, his Kinsfolks, his Friends, and againſt all Men uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſally; all ſins, I ſay, againſt God and all Men heaped together, nameth he, that nameth Rebellion. For concerning the offence of Gods Majeſty, who ſeeth not that Rebellion riſeth firſt by contempt of God and of his holy Ordinances and Laws, wherein he ſo ſtraitly commandeth Obedience, forbiddeth. Diſobedience and Rebellion? And beſides, the diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor done by Rebels unto Gods holy name, by their breaking of their Oath made to their Prince, with the atteſtation of Gods Name, and calling of his Majeſty to witneſs: Who heareth not the horrible Oaths and Blaſphemies of Gods holy Name, that are uſed daily amongſt Rebels, that is, either amongſt them, or heareth the truth of their Behavior? Who knoweth not that Rebels do not only themſelves leave all Works neceſſary to be done upon Work-days, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>done, whiles they accompliſh their abominable work of Rebellion, and to compel others that would gladly be well occupied to do the ſame; but alſo how Rebels do not only leave the Sabbath-day of the
<pb n="608" facs="tcp:54673:311"/> Lord unſanctified, the Temple and Church of the Lord unreſorted unto, but alſo do by their Works of wickedneſs, moſt horribly prophane and pollute the Sabbath-day, ſerving Satan, and by doing of his work, making it the Devils day inſtead of the Lords day? Beſides that, they compel good Men that would gladly ſerve the Lord, aſſembling in his Temple and Church upon his day, as becometh the Lords Servants, to Aſſemble and meet Armed in the Field, to reſiſt the fury of ſuch Rebels. Yea, and many Rebels, leſt they ſhould leave any part of Gods Commandments in the firſt Table of his Law unbroken, or any ſin againſt God undone, do make Rebellion for the maintainance of their Images and Idols, and of their Idolatry com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, or to be committed by them; and in deſpite of God, cut and tear in ſunder his holy Word, and tread it under their Feet, as of late ye know was done.</p>
                     <p>
                        <note place="margin">The fifth Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</note>As concerning the ſecond Table of Gods Law, and all ſins that may be committed againſt Man, who ſeeth not that they be contained in Rebellion? For firſt, the Rebels do not only diſhonor their Prince, the Parent of their Country, but alſo do diſhonor and ſhame their natural Parents, if they have any, do ſhame their Kindred and Friends, do diſinherit and undo for ever their Children and Heirs.<note place="margin">The ſixth and eighth Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</note> Thefts, Robbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries and Murders, which of all ſins are moſt loath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of moſt Men, are in no Men ſo much, nor ſo perniciouſly and miſchievouſly as in Rebels. For the moſt arrant Thieves, cruelleſt Murderers that ever were, ſo long as they refrain from Rebellion, as they are not many in number, ſo ſpreadeth their wickedneſs and damnation unto a few; they ſpoil but a few, they ſhed the Blood but of a few in compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon. But Rebels are the cauſe of infinite Robberies, and murderers of great Multitudes, and of thoſe alſo whom they ſhould defend from the ſpoil and violence of other; and as Rebels are many in number, ſo doth their wickedneſs and damnation ſpread it ſelf unto ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny.
<pb n="609" facs="tcp:54673:311"/> And if Whoredom and Adultery amongſt ſuch Perſons as are agreeable to ſuch wickedneſs, are (as they indeed be) moſt damnable:<note place="margin">The Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment</note> What are the forcible oppreſſions of Matrons and Mens Wives, and the vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating and deflouring of Virgins and Maids, which are moſt rife with Rebels? How horrible and damnable think you are they? Now beſides that,<note place="margin">The Nninth Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</note> Rebels by breach of their Faith given, and the Oath made to their Prince, be guilty of moſt damnable Perjury: It is wondrous to ſee what falſe colours and feigned cauſes, by ſlanderous lies made upon their Prince and the Counſellors, Rebels will deviſe to cloak their Rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion withal, which is the worſt and moſt damnable of all falſe witneſs-bearing that may be poſſible: For what ſhould I ſpeak of coveting or deſiring of other Mens Wives, Houſes, Lands, Goods and Servants,<note place="margin">The Tenth Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</note> in Rebels, who by their wills would leave unto no Man any thing of his own.</p>
                     <p>Thus you ſee that all good Laws are by Rebels vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated and broken, and that all ſins poſſible to be commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted againſt God or Man, be contained in Rebellion; which ſins if a Man liſt to name by the accuſtomed names of the ſeven capital or deadly ſins, as Pride, Envy, Wrath, Covetouſneſs, Sloth, Gluttony and Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chery; he ſhall find them all in Rebellion, and amongſt Rebels. For firſt, As Ambition and Deſire to be aloft, which is the property of Pride, ſtirreth up many Mens minds to Rebellion; ſo cometh it of a <hi>Luciferian</hi> pride and preſumption, that a few rebellious Subjects ſhould ſet themſelves up againſt the Majeſty of their Prince, againſt the Wiſdom of the Counſellors, againſt the power and force of all Nobility, and the faithful Subjects and People of the whole Realm. As for Envy, Wrath, Murder, and deſire of Blood, and covetouſneſs of other Mens Goods, Lands and Livings, they are the inſeparable accidents of all Rebels, and peculiar Properties that do uſually ſtir up wicked Men unto Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion.</p>
                     <pb n="610" facs="tcp:54673:312"/>
                     <p>Now ſuch as by Riotouſneſs, Gluttony, Drunkenneſs, exceſs of Apparel, and unthrifty Games, have waſted their own Goods unthriftily; the ſame are moſt apt unto and moſt deſirous of Rebellion, whereby they truſt to come by other Mens Goods unlawfully and violently. And where other Gluttons and Drunkards take too much of ſuch Meats<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and Drinks as are ſerved to Tables, Rebels waſte and conſume in ſhort ſpace, all Corn in Barns, Fields, or elſewhere, whole Garners, whole Store-houſes, whole Sellers, devour whole Flocks of Sheep, whole Droves of Oxen and Kine. And as Rebels that are married, leaving their own Wives at home, do moſt ungraciouſly; ſo much more do un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>married Men, worſe than any Stallions or Horſes, (being now by Rebellion ſet at liberty from Correction of Laws, which bridled them before,) abuſe by force, other Mens Wives and Daughters, and raviſh Virgins and Maids moſt ſhamefully, abominably, and dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nably.</p>
                     <p>Thus all ſins, by all names that ſins may be named, and by all means that ſins may be committed and wrought, do all wholly upon heaps follow Rebellion, and are to be found altogether amongſt Rebels. Now whereas Peſtilence,<note place="margin">2 Reg. 24. cap. 14.</note> Famine and War, are by the Holy Scriptures declared to be the greateſt Worldly Plagues and Miſeries that likely can be; it is evident, that all the Miſeries that all theſe Plagues have in them, do wholly altogether follow Rebellion; wherein, as all their Miſeries be, ſo is there much more miſchief than in them all.</p>
                     <p>For it is known, that in the reſorting of great Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panies of Men together, which in Rebellion happeneth both upon the part of true Subjects and of the Rebels, by their cloſe lying together, and corruption of the Air and place where they do lie, with Ordure and much filth in the hot weather, and by unwhol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom Lodging, and lying often upon the ground, ſpecially in cold and wet weather in Winter, by their unwholſom Diet, and feeding at all times,
<pb n="611" facs="tcp:54673:312"/> and often by Famin, and lack of Meat and Drink in due time; and again, by taking too much at other times: It is well known, I ſay, that as well Plagues and Peſtilences, as all other kinds of Sickneſſes and Maladies, by theſe means grow up and ſpring amongſt Men, whereby more Men are conſumed at the length, than are by dint of Sword ſuddenly ſlain in the Field. So that not only Peſtilences, but alſo all other Sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes, Diſeaſes and Maladies, do follow Rebellion, which are much more horrible than Plagues, Peſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lences and Diſeaſes, ſent directly from God, as here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after ſhall appear more plainly.</p>
                     <p>And as for Hunger and Famin, they are the pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar companions of Rebellion; for while Rebels do in ſhort time ſpoil and conſume all Corn and neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Proviſion, which Men with their labors had gotten and appointed upon, for their finding the whole Year after; and alſo do let all other Men, Husband-men, and others, from their Husbandry, and other neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary works, whereby Proviſion ſhould be made for times to come; who ſeeth not that extream Famin and Hunger muſt needs ſhortly enſue and follow Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion?<note place="margin">2 Reg. 24. cap. 24.</note> Now whereas the wiſe King and godly Prophet <hi>David</hi> judged War to be worſe than either Famin or Peſtilence, for that theſe two are often ſuffered by God for Mans amendment, and be not ſins of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves; but Wars have always the ſins and miſchiefs of Men, upon the one ſide or other joyned with them, and therefore is War the greateſt of theſe worldly miſchiefs; but of all Wars, Civil War is the worſt, and far more abominable yet is Rebellion than any Civil War, being unworthy the name of any War; ſo far it exceedeth all Wars in all naughtineſs, in all miſchief, and in all abomination. And therefore our Saviour Chriſt denounceth deſolation and deſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to that Realm,<note place="margin">Mat. 12.</note> that by Sedition and Rebellion is divided in it ſelf.</p>
                     <pb n="612" facs="tcp:54673:313"/>
                     <p>Now as I have ſhewed before, that Peſtilence and Famine, ſo is it yet more evident, that all the cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities, miſeries, and miſchiefs of War, be more grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous, and do more follow Rebellion than any other War, as being far worſe than all other Wars. For not only thoſe ordinary and uſual miſchiefs and mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeries of other Wars do follow Rebellion, as Corn, and other things neceſſary to Mans uſe, to be ſpoiled, Houſes, Villages, Towns, Cities to be taken, ſacked, burned and deſtroyed, not only many very wealthy Men, but whole Countries to be impoveriſhed and utterly beggered, many thouſands of Men to be ſlain and murthered, Women and Maids to be violated and deflowred; which things when they are done by Fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign Enemies, we do much mourn, as we have great cauſes; yet are all theſe miſeries without any wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs wrought by any of our own Countrymen. But when theſe miſchiefs are wrought in Rebellion by them that ſhould be Friends, by Countrymen, by Kinſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, by thoſe that ſhould defend their Country and Country-men from ſuch miſeries; the miſery is nothing ſo great as is the miſchief and wickedneſs, when the Subjects unnaturally do Rebel againſt their Prince, whoſe honor and life they ſhould defend, though it were with the loſs of their own lives. Country-men diſturb the publick Peace and Quietneſs of their Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, for defence of whoſe Quietneſs they ſhould ſpend their lives; the Brother to ſeek, and often to work the death of his Brother, the Son of the Father, the Father to ſeek or procure the death of his Sons, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at Mans Age, and by their faults to diſinherit their innocent Children and Kinſmen their Heirs for ever, for whom they might purchaſe Livings and Lands, as natural Parents do take care and pains, and to be at great coſts and charges; and univerſally inſtead of all Quietneſs, Joy and Felicity, which do follow bleſſed Peace and due Obedience, to bring in all troubles, ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, diſquietneſs of Minds and Bodies, and all Miſchief and Calamity, to turn all good Order upſide down, to
<pb n="613" facs="tcp:54673:313"/> bring all good Laws in contempt, and to tread them under feet, to oppreſs all Vertue and Honeſty, and all vertuous and honeſt Perſons, and to ſet all Vice and Wickedneſs, and all vicious and wicked Men at li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty; to work their wicked Wills, which were before bridled by wholſom Laws, to weaken, to overthrow, and to conſume the ſtrength of the Realm, their natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Country, as well by the ſpending and waſting of the Mony and Treaſure of the Prince and Realm, as by murdering the People of the ſame,<note place="margin">Prov. 14.</note> their own Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try-men, who ſhould defend the honor of their Prince and liberty of their Country, againſt the Invaſion of Foreign Enemies: And ſo finally, To make their Country thus by their miſchief weakned, ready to be a prey and ſpoil to all outward Enemies that will in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vade it, to the utter and perpetual captivity, ſlavery, and deſtruction of all their Country-men, their Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, their Friends, their Kinsfolk left alive, whom by their wicked Rebellion, they procure to be delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red into the hands of the Foreign Enemies, as much as in them doth lie.</p>
                     <p>In Foreign Wars our Country-men in obtaining the Victory win the praiſe of valiantneſs; yea, and though they were overcome and ſlain, yet win they an honeſt commendation in this World, and die in a good Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience for ſerving God, their Prince, and their Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, and be Children of eternal Salvation: But the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bels, how deſperate and ſtrong ſoever they be, yet win they ſhame here in fighting againſt God, their Prince and Country, and therefore juſtly do fall headlong in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Hell if they die, and live in ſhame and fearful Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience though they eſcape.</p>
                     <p>But commonly they be rewarded with ſhameful Deaths, their Hands and Carcaſſes ſet upon Poles, and hanged in Chains, eaten with Kites and Crows, judged unworthy the honor of Burial; and ſo their Souls, if they repent not, (as commonly they do not,) the Devil hurrieth them into Hell in the midſt of their miſchief. For which dreadful execution, St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſheweth the
<pb n="614" facs="tcp:54673:314"/> cauſe of Obedience,<note place="margin">Rom. 13.</note> not only for fear of Death, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo in Conſcience to God-ward, for fear of eternal dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation in the World to come.</p>
                     <p>Wherefore good People, let us, as the Children of Obedience, fear the dreadful Execution of God, and live in quiet Obedience, to be the Children of ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting Salvation. For as Heaven is the place of good obedient Subjects, and Hell the Priſon and Dungeon of Rebels againſt God and their Prince; ſo is that Realm happy where moſt obedience of Subjects doth appear, being the very Figure of Heaven; and contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riwiſe where moſt Rebellions and Rebels be, there is the expreſs ſimilitude of Hell; and the Rebels them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves are the very Figures of Fiends and Devils, and their Captain the ungracious pattern of <hi>Lucifer</hi> and Satan, the Prince of darkneſs; of whoſe Rebellion as they be Followers, ſo ſhall they of his damnation in Hell undoubtedly be partakers; and as undoubtedly Children of Peace, the inheriters of Heaven with God the Father, God the Son, and God the Holy Ghoſt.

                     <p>Likewiſe, is it to be ſeen in the Holy Scriptures, how that great Rebellion, which the Traitor <hi>Seba</hi> moved in <hi>Iſrael,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">2 King. 20.</note> was ſuddenly appeaſed, the head of the Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Traitor (by the means of a ſilly Woman,) being cut off. And as the Holy Scripture doth ſhew, ſo doth daily experience prove, that the Counſels, Conſpira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, and attempts of Rebels, never took effect, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther came to good, but to moſt horrible end. For though God doth oftentimes proſper juſt and lawful Enemies,<note place="margin">Pſ. 20.12.</note> which be no Subjects, againſt their Foreign Enemies; yet did he never long proſper Rebellious Subjects againſt their Prince, were they never ſo great in Authority,<note place="margin">Gen. 14.</note> or ſo many in number. Five Princes or Kings (for ſo the Scripture termeth them,) with all their multitudes, could not prevail againſt <hi>Chedorlao<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer,</hi> unto whom they had promiſed Loyalty and Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience,
<pb n="619" facs="tcp:54673:316"/> and had continued in the ſame certain years, but they were all overthrown and taken Priſoners by him; but <hi>Abraham</hi> with his Family and Kinsfolks, an handful of Men in reſpect, owing no ſubjection unto <hi>Chedorlaomer,</hi> overthrew him and all his Hoſt in Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tel, and recovered the Priſoners, and delivered them. So that though War be ſo dreadful and cruel a thing, as it is, yet doth God often proſper a few in lawful Wars with Foreign Enemies, againſt many thouſands; but never yet proſpered he Subjects being Rebels a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt their natural Sovereign, were they never ſo great or noble, ſo many, ſo ſtout, ſo witty and politic, but always they came by the overthrow, and to a ſhame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful end; ſo much doth God abhor Rebellion more than other Wars, though otherwiſe being ſo dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, and ſo great a deſtruction to Mankind. Though not only great multitudes of the rude and raſcal Commons, but ſometime alſo Men of great Wit, Nobility and Authority, have moved Rebellions a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt their lawful Princes, (whereas true Nobility ſhould moſt abhor ſuch Villanous, and true wiſdom ſhould moſt deteſt ſuch frantic Rebellion,) though they ſhould pretend ſundry cauſes, as the Redreſs of the Common-wealth (which Rebellion of all other miſchiefs doth moſt deſtroy,) or Reformation of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, (whereas Rebellion is moſt againſt all true Religion,) though they have made a great ſhew of holy meaning by beginning their Rebellions with a counterfeit Service of God,<note place="margin">2 Reg. 15. c. 12.</note> (as did wicked <hi>Abſalom</hi> begin his Rebellion with Sacrificing unto God,) though they diſplay and bear about Enſigns and Banners, which are acceptable unto the rude ignorant common peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; great multitudes of whom by ſuch falſe pretences and ſhews, they do deceive and draw unto them; yet were the multitudes of the Rebels never ſo huge and great, the Captains never ſo noble, politic and witty, the Pretences feigned to be never ſo good and holy, yet the ſpeedy overthrow of all Rebels, of what number, State or Condition ſoever they were, or what
<pb n="620" facs="tcp:54673:317"/> colour or cauſe ſoever they pretended, is and ever hath been ſuch, that God thereby doth ſhew, that he allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth neither the dignity of any Perſon, nor the multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of any People, nor the weight of any Cauſe, as ſufficient, for the which the Subjects may move Rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion againſt their Princes.</p>
                     <p>Turn over and read the Hiſtories of all Nations, look over the Chronicles of our own Country, call to mind ſo many Rebellions of old time, and ſome yet freſh in memory, ye ſhall not find that God ever proſpered any Rebellion againſt their natural and lawful Prince; but contrariwiſe, that the Rebels were overthrown and ſlain, and ſuch as were taken Priſoners dreadfully executed. Conſider the great and noble Families of Dukes, Marqueſſes, Earls, and other Lords, whoſe Names ye ſhall read in our Chronicles, now clean ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſhed and gone, and ſeek out the cauſes of the decay; you ſhall find, that not lack of Iſſue and Heirs Male hath ſo much wrought that decay, and waſt of Noble Bloods and Houſes, as hath Rebellion.</p>
                     <p>And for ſo much as the Redreſs of the Common-wealth hath of old been the uſual feined pretence of Rebels, and Religion now of late beginneth to be a colour of Rebellion; let all godly and diſcreet Subjects conſider well of both, and firſt concerning Religion. If peaceable King <hi>Solomon</hi> was judged of God to be more meet to build his Temple, (whereby the ordering of Religion is meant,) than his Father King <hi>David,</hi> though otherwiſe a moſt godly King; for that <hi>David</hi> was a great Warrior, and had ſhed much Blood, though it were in his Wars againſt the Enemies of God: Of this may all godly and reaſonable Subjects conſider, that a peaceable Prince, ſpecially our moſt peaceable and merciful King, who hath hitherto ſhed no Blood at all, no, not of his moſt deadly Enemies, is more like and far meeter, either to ſet up or to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain true Religion, than are bloody Rebels, who have not ſhed the Blood of Gods Enemies, as King <hi>David</hi> had done, but do ſeek to ſhed the Blood of Gods
<pb n="621" facs="tcp:54673:317"/> Friends, of their own Country-men, and of their own moſt dear Friends and Kinsfolk, yea, the deſtruction of their moſt gracious Prince and natural Country, for defence of whom they ought to be ready to ſhed their Blood if need ſhould ſo require. What a Religion it is, that ſuch Men by ſuch means would reſtore, may eaſily be judged; even as good a Religion ſurely, as Rebels be good Men and obedient Subjects, and as Rebellion is a good Mean of Redreſs and Reformation, being it ſelf the greateſt deformation of all that may poſſibly be. But as the truth of the Goſpel of our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour Chriſt, being quietly and ſoberly taught, though it do coſt them their lives that do teach it, is able to maintain the true Religion; ſo hath a frantic Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion need of ſuch furious maintainances as is Rebelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and of ſuch Patrons as are Rebels, being ready not to die for the true Religion, but to kill all that ſhall or dare ſpeak againſt their falſe Superſtition and wicked Idolatry. Now concerning pretences of any Redreſs of the Common-wealth made by Rebels, eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Man that hath but half an Eye may ſee how vain they be; Rebellion being, as I have before declared, the greateſt ruin and deſtruction of all Common-wealths that may be poſſible. And who ſo looketh on the one part upon the Perſons and Government of the Kings moſt Honorable Counſellors, by the experiment of ſo many years proved honorable to his Majeſty, and moſt profitable and beneficial unto our Country and Country-men; and on the other part, conſidereth the Perſons, State and Conditions of the Rebels them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, the Reformers, as they take upon them, of the preſent Government, he ſhall find that the moſt raſh and hair-brain'd Men, the greateſt unthrifts that have moſt lewdly waſted their own Goods and Lands, thoſe that are over the ears in debt, and ſuch as for their Thefts, Robberies and Murders, dare not in any well governed Common-wealth, where good Laws are in force, ſhew their Faces, ſuch as are of moſt lewd and wicked Behavior and Life, and all ſuch as will not or
<pb n="622" facs="tcp:54673:318"/> cannot live in peace, are always moſt ready to move Rebellion, or take part with Rebels. And are not theſe meet Men, trow you, to reſtore the Common-wealth decayed, who have ſo ſpoiled and conſumed all their own Wealth and Thrift? and very like to amend other Mens manners, who have ſo vile Vices and abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minable; Conditions themſelves? Surely, that which they falſely call Reformation, is indeed not only a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>facing or deformation, but alſo an utter deſtruction of all Common-wealth, as would well appear, might the Rebels have their wills? and doth right well, and too well appear by their doing in ſuch places of the Country where Rebels do rout, where though they tarry but a very little while, they make ſuch Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation that they deſtroy all places, and undo all Men where they come, that the Child yet unborn may rue it, and ſhall many Years hereafter curſe them.</p>
                     <p>Let no good and diſcreet Subjects therefore follow the Flag or Banner diſplayed to Rebellion, and born by Rebels, though it have the image of the Plough painted therein, with <hi>God ſpeed the Plough,</hi> written under in great Letters, knowing that none hinder the Plough more than Rebels, who will neither go to the Plough themſelves, nor ſuffer other that would go unto it. And though ſome Rebels bear the Picture of the five wounds painted, againſt thoſe who put their only hope of Salvation in the wounds of Chriſt; not thoſe wounds which are painted in a Clout by ſome lewd Painter, but in thoſe wounds which Chriſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf bare in his precious Body; though they little knowing what the Croſs of Chriſt meaneth, which neither Carver nor Painter can make, do bear the Image of the Croſs painted in a Rag, againſt thoſe that have the Croſs of Chriſt painted in their Hearts, yea, though they paint withal in their Flags, <hi>Hoc ſigno vinces. By this Sign thou ſhalt get the Victory,</hi> by a moſt fond imitation of the Poſie of <hi>Conſtantinus Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus,</hi> that noble Chriſtian Emperor, and great Conque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror
<pb n="623" facs="tcp:54673:318"/> of Gods Enemies, (a moſt unmeet Enſign for Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bels,) the Enemies of God, their Prince and Country, or what other Banner ſoever they ſhall bear; yet let no good and godly Subject, upon any hope of Victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry or good Succeſs, follow ſuch Standard-bearers of Rebellion.</p>
                     <p>For as examples of ſuch Practices are to be found as well in the Hiſtories of old, as alſo of latter Rebellions, in our Fathers and our freſh Memory; ſo notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding theſe Pretences made and Banners born, are recorded withal to perpetual Memory, the great and horrible murders of infinite multitudes and thouſands of the Common People ſlain in Rebellion, dreadful executions of the Authors and Captains, the pitiful undoing of their Wives and Children, and diſinherit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Heirs of the Rebels for ever, the ſpoiling, waſting, and deſtruction of the People and Country where Rebellion was firſt begun, that the Child then, and yet unborn might rue and lament it, with the final overthrow and ſhameful deaths of all Rebels, ſet forth as well in the Hiſtories of Foreign Nations, as in the Chronicles of our own Country, ſome thereof being yet in freſh Memory, which if they were collected to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, would make many Volums and Books: But on the contrary part, all good luck, ſucceſs and proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perity that ever hapned unto any Rebels of any Age, Time or Country, may be contained in a very few lines or words.</p>
                     <p>Wherefore, to conclude, let all good Subjects, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering how horrible a ſin againſt God, their Prince, their Country and Country-men, againſt all Gods and Mans Laws Rebellion is, being indeed not one ſeveral ſin, but all ſins againſt God and Man heaped toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, conſidering the miſchievous life and deeds, and the ſhameful ends and deaths of all Rebels hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto; and the pitiful undoing of their Wives, Children and Families, and diſinheriting of their Heirs for ever; and above all things conſidering the eternal damnation that is prepared for all impenitent Rebels in
<pb n="624" facs="tcp:54673:319"/> Hell, with Satan the firſt Founder of Rebellion, and Grand Captain of all Rebels; let all good Subjects (I ſay,) conſidering theſe things, avoid and flee all Rebellion as the greateſt of all miſchiefs, and embrace due obedience to God and our Prince, as the greateſt of all Vertues, that we may both eſcape all Evils and Miſeries that do follow Rebellion in this World, and eternal damnation in the World to come, and enjoy Peace, Quietneſs and Security, with all other Gods benefits and bleſſings which follow Obedience in this life, and finally may enjoy the Kingdom of Heaven, the peculiar place of all obedient Subjects to God and their Prince in the World to come; which I beſeech God, the King of all Kings, grant unto us for the obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience of his Son our Saviour Jeſus Chriſt; unto whom with the Father and the Holy Ghoſt, one God and King immortal, all honor, ſervice and obedience of all his Creatures is due for ever. <hi>Amen.</hi>

                     <p>WHereas, after both Doctrin and examples of due Obedience of Subjects to their Princes, I declared laſtly unto you, what an abominable ſin againſt God and Man Rebellion is, and what horrible Plagues, Puniſhments and Deaths, with Death everlaſting, finally doth hang over the heads of all Rebels; it ſhall not be either impertinent or unprofitable now to declare who they be, whom the Devil, the firſt Author and Founder of Rebellion, doth chiefly uſe, to the ſtirring up of Subjects to Rebel againſt their lawful Princes; that knowing them, ye may flee them and their damnable ſuggeſtions, avoid all Rebellion, and eſcape the horrible plagues, and dreadful death and damnation eternal, finally due to all Rebels.</p>
                     <p>Though many cauſes of Rebellion may be reckon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and almoſt as many as there be Vices in Men and Women, as hath been before noted; yet in this place I will only touch the principal and moſt uſual cauſes, as ſpecially Ambition and Ignorance. By Ambition, I mean, the unlawful and reſtleſs deſire in Men, to be of higher eſtate than God hath given or appointed un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them. By Ignorance, I mean no unskilfulneſs in Arts and Sciences, but the lack of knowledge of Gods bleſſed Will declared in his holy Word, which teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth both extreamly to abhor all Rebellion, as being the root of all miſchief, and ſpecially to delight in obedience, as the beginning and Foundation of all goodneſs, as hath been alſo before ſpecified. And as theſe are the two chief cauſes of Rebellion, ſo are there ſpecially two ſorts of Men in whom theſe Vices
<pb n="627" facs="tcp:54673:320"/> do Reign, by whom the Devil, the Author of all e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil, doth chiefly ſtir up all Diſobedience and Rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion.</p>
                     <p>The reſtleſs Ambitious having once determined by one means or other to atchieve to their intended pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, when they cannot by lawful and peaceable means climb ſo high as they do deſire, they attempt the ſame by force and violence; wherein, when they cannot prevail againſt the ordinary Authority and Power of lawful Princes and Governors themſelves alone, they do ſeek the aid and help of the ignorant multitude, abuſing them to their wicked purpoſe. Wherefore, ſeeing a few ambitious and malitious are the Authors and Heads, and multitudes of ignorant Men are the Miniſters and furtherers of Rebellion; the chief Point of this part ſhall be as well to notifie to the ſimple and ignorant Men, who they be that have been and be uſual Authors of Rebellion, that they may know them; and alſo to admoniſh them to beware of the ſubtil ſuggeſtions of ſuch reſtleſs ambitious Perſons, and ſo to flee them; that Rebellions, (though attemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by a few Ambitious,) through the lack of main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainance by any multitudes, may ſpeedily and eaſily, without any great labor, danger or damage, be re-reſſed and clearly extinguiſhed.</p>
                     <p>It is well known, as well by all Hiſtories as by dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Experience, that none have either more ambiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly aſpired above Emperors, Kings and Princes; nor have more perniciouſly moved the ignorant People to Rebellion againſt their Princes, than certain Perſons which falſly challenge to themſelves to be only count<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and called Spiritual. I muſt therefore here yet once again briefly put you (good People,) in remembrance out of Gods holy Word, how our Saviour Jeſus Chriſt and his holy Apoſtles, the Heads and chief of all true Spiritual and Eccleſiaſtical Men, behaved themſelves towards the Princes and Rulers of their time, though not the beſt Governors that ever were, that you be not ignorant whether they be the true Diſciples and
<pb n="628" facs="tcp:54673:321"/> followers of Chriſt and his Apoſtles, and ſo true ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Men, that either by Ambition do ſo highly aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire, or do moſt maliciouſly teach, or moſt pernici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly do execute Rebellion againſt their lawful Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, being the worſt of all carnal Works and miſchie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous Deeds.</p>

                        </note>The holy Scriptures do teach moſt expreſly, that our Saviour Chriſt himſelf, and his Apoſtles, St. <hi>Paul,</hi> St. <hi>Peter,</hi> with others, were unto the Magiſtrates and higher Powers, which ruled at their being upon the Earth, both obedient themſelves, and did alſo dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently and earneſtly exhort all other Chriſtians to the like obedience unto their Princes and Governors; whereby it is evident, that Men of the Clergy and Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſtical Miniſters, as their Succeſſors ought both themſelves ſpecially, and before other, to be obedient unto their Princes, and alſo to exhort all others unto the ſame. Our Saviour Chriſt likewiſe teaching by his Doctrin that his Kingdom was not of this World, did by his Example in fleeing from thoſe that would have made him King, confirm the ſame; expreſly alſo forbidding his Apoſtles, and by them the whole Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy, all Princely Dominion over People and Nations; and he, and his holy Apoſtles likewiſe, namely <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>Paul,</hi> did forbid unto all Eccleſiaſtical Miniſters, dominion over the Church of Chriſt. And indeed, whiles the Eccleſiaſtical Miniſters continued in Chriſts Church, in that order that is in Chriſts Word pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed unto them, and in Chriſtian Kingdoms kept themſelves obedient to their own Princes, as the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Scripture doth teach them; both was Chriſts Church more clear from ambitious Emulations and Contentions, and the State of Chriſtian Kingdoms leſs ſubject unto Tumults and Rebellions. But after that Ambition and deſire of Dominion ent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red once into Eccleſiaſtical Miniſters, whoſe great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, after the Doctrin and Example of our Saviour, ſhould chiefly ſtand in humbling themſelves; and that the Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi> being by the order of Gods Word,
<pb n="629" facs="tcp:54673:321"/> none other than the Biſhop of that one See and Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs, and never yet well able to govern the ſame, did by intolerable Ambition, challenge not only to he the Head of all the Church diſperſed throughout the World, but alſo to be Lord of all Kingdoms of the World, as is expreſly ſet forth in the Book of his own Canon Laws, moſt contrary to the Doctrin and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of our Saviour Chriſt, whoſe Vicar, and of his Apoſtles, namely <hi>Peter,</hi> whoſe Succeſſor he pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to be: After this Ambition entred, and his Chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge once made by the Biſhop of <hi>Rome,</hi> he became at once the ſpoiler and deſtroyer both of the Church, which is the Kingdom of our Saviour Chriſt, and of the Chriſtian Empire, and all Chriſtian Kingdoms, as an Univerſal Tyrant over all.</p>
                     <p>And whereas, before that Challenge made, there was great amity and love amongſt the Chriſtians of all Countries; hereupon began Emulation and much Hatred between the Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi> and his Clergy and Friends on the one part, and the <hi>Grecian</hi> Clergy and Chriſtians of the Eaſt on the other part, for that they refuſed to acknowledge any ſuch Supream Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of the Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi> over them: The Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi> for this cauſe amongſt other, not only nam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them, and taking them for Schiſmatics, but alſo never ceaſing to perſecute them; and the Emperors who had their See and continuance in <hi>Greece,</hi> by ſtir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of the Subjects to Rebellion againſt their Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign Lords, and by raiſing deadly hatred and moſt cruel Wars between them and other Chriſtian Princes.

The ambitious intents and moſt ſubtil drifts of the Biſhops of <hi>Rome</hi> in theſe their Practices, appeared evidently by their bold attempt in ſpoiling and robbing the Emperors of their Towns, Cities, Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minions and Kingdoms, in <hi>Italy, Lombardy</hi> and <hi>Sici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi> of ancient right belonging to the Empire; and by joyning of them unto their Biſhoprick of <hi>Rome,</hi> or elſe giving them unto ſtrangers, to hold them of the Church and Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi> as in <hi>capite,</hi> and as of the chief Lords thereof, in which tenure they hold the moſt part thereof even at this day. But theſe ambitious, and indeed traitorous means and ſpoiling of their Sovereign Lords; the Biſhops of <hi>Rome,</hi> of Prieſts, and none other by right than the Biſhops of one City and Dioceſs, are by falſe uſurpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion become great Lords of many Dominions, mighty Princes, yea, or Emperors rather, as claiming to have divers Princes and Kings to their Vaſſals, Liege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men and Subjects; as in the ſame Hiſtories written by
<pb n="631" facs="tcp:54673:322"/> their own Familiars and Courtiers, is to be ſeen. And indeed, ſince the time that the Biſhops of <hi>Rome</hi> by Ambition, Treaſon and Uſurpation, atchieved and at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained to this height and greatneſs, they behaved themſelves more like Princes, Kings and Emperors in all things, than remained like Prieſts, Biſhops, and Eccleſiaſtical or (as they would be called) Spiritual perſons, in any one thing at all. For after this rate they have handled other Kings and Princes of other Realms throughout Chriſtendom, as well as their So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereign Lords the Emperors, uſually diſcharging their Subjects of their Oath of Fidelity, and ſo ſtir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring them up to Rebellion againſt their natural Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, whereof ſome examples ſhall in the laſt part hereof be notified unto you.</p>
                     <p>Wherefore let all good Subjects knowing theſe, the ſpecial Inſtruments and Miniſters of the Devil, to the ſtirring up of all Rebellions, avoid and flee them and the peſtilent ſuggeſtions of ſuch Foreign Uſurpers and their Adherents, and embrace all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience to God, and their natural Princes and So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereigns, that they may enjoy Gods bleſſings and their Princes favor, all Peace, Quietneſs, Security in this World, and finally attain through Chriſt our Saviour, life everlaſting in the World to come; which God the Father for the ſame our Saviour Jeſus Chriſt his ſake grant unto us all.

For he that made them had no pity upon them, neither would ſpare them, and all for their ignorance.</p>
                     <p>And the Holy Scriptures do teach, that the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple that will not ſee with their Eyes nor hear with their Ears, to learn, and to underſtand with their Hearts, cannot be converted and ſaved. And the wicked themſelves being damned in Hell, ſhall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs ignorance in Gods Word to have brought them thereunto; ſaying, We have erred from the way of the truth, and the light of Righteouſneſs hath not ſhined unto us, and the Sun of underſtanding

For all are commanded to read or hear, to ſearch and ſtudy the holy Scriptures, and are promiſed un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding to be given them from God, if they ſo do; all are charged not to believe either any dead Man, nor if an Angel ſhould ſpeak from Heaven, much leſs if the Pope do ſpeak from <hi>Rome</hi> againſt or contrary to the Word of God, from the which we may not decline, neither to the right hand nor to the left.</p>
                     <p>In Gods Word Princes muſt learn how to obey God and to govern Men; in Gods Word Subjects muſt learn Obedience both to God and their Princes. Old Men and young, rich and poor, all Men and Women, all Eſtates, Sexes and Ages, are taught their ſeveral Duties in the Word of God. For the Word of God is bright, giving light unto all Mens Eyes, the ſhining Lamp directing all Mens Paths and Steps. Let us therefore awake from the ſleep and darkneſs of Ignorance, and open our Eyes that we may ſee the light; let us riſe from the works of darkneſs, that we may eſcape eternal darkneſs, the due reward thereof, and let us walk in the light of Gods Word, whiles we have light, as becometh the
